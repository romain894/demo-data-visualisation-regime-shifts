"405","2020-05-26 00:00:00","Livestock-game farming regime shift","Therezah Achieng","Michelle Dyer, Reinette (Oonsie) Biggs, Kristi Maciejewski","<p style='text-align: justify;'>The trend of land use changing from livestock farming to game farming in the Eastern Cape has been on the rise since the 1980s (Lloyd <em>et al</em>., 2002), and has major implications for biodiversity and a wide variety of ecosystem services and human wellbeing (Sun &amp; M&uuml;ller, 2014). The growth in game farming was boosted by free market policies and renewed conservation interests in the 1970s, coupled with the introduction of stock reduction schemes after the prolonged drought of the 1960s, which lowered cattle prices (Smith &amp; Wilson, 2002). Prior to converting into game farms, land use in Amakhala game reserve in the Eastern Cape was predominantly agrarian, including chicory and maize farming, livestock farms and different forms of subsistence farming. Large portions of land were used for commercial livestock farming, mostly stocked with sheep and goat. Farmworkers and farm dwellers were able to move about the land and formed a community; that is, they interacted and shared residential areas, social and cultural activity spaces on the livestock farms. However, these interactions changed with the erection of fences to farm game animals, and the relocation of farm workers to nearby towns and centres. The nature of social relations also changed and the concept of a &lsquo;community&rsquo; on the game farms took on very different characteristics. The current land use (game farming), has been reorganized into new structures and functions that accommodate tourism industry (construction of lodges and tourist facilities) and maximize profit. This reconfiguration had ecological, social, economic and cultural implications on human wellbeing.&nbsp; &nbsp;One way in which this regime shift has been interpreted is that; livestock farming was more about people on the inside (farmers and dwellers), while game farming is seen to be more about people on the outside (visitors).</p>","Livestock farming to game farming","Agro-ecosystems","Small-scale subsistence crop cultivation, Intensive livestock production (eg feedlots, dairies), Extensive livestock production (natural rangelands), Conservation, Tourism","Local/landscape (e.g. lake, catchment, community)","Africa","Southern Africa","South Africa","Environmental shocks (eg floods)","Small-scale subsistence crop cultivation, Intensive livestock production (eg feedlots), Extensive livestock production (rangelands), Conservation, Tourism","Agro-ecosystems","","Biodiversity","Freshwater, Food crops, Livestock, Wild animal and plant products, Woodfuel","","Recreation","Food and nutrition, Livelihoods and economic activity, Security of housing & infrastructure, Cultural, aesthetic and recreational values, Cultural identity, Social conflict","Good health and well-being, Gender equality, Decent work and economic growth","Local/landscape","Years, Decades","Hysteretic","Contemporary observations","Contested – Reasonable evidence both for and against the existence of RS","Well established – Wide agreement on the underlying mechanism","<p style='text-align: justify;'><strong>Livestock farming</strong>: This regime was characterised by livestock farms where sheep, goats and dairy were kept mainly for commercial purposes. The livestock farms also served as homes to different group of dwellers including workers and farmers, alongside their families. Food was easily produced because there was space to grow own vegetables and keep poultry, hunt game meat and harvest fuelwood. The regime also provided security of space and livelihoods and valued social and community interactions. There was also ownership of assets (e.g. livestock) at individual level, especially to workers.</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'><strong>Game farming: </strong>This regime is characterised by introduction of fences that caged in purchased wild animals, both extralimital and local species (Maciejewski &amp; Kerley, 2014), introduced to attract foreign visitors (Maciejewski, 2012). It also involves establishment of lodges, camping sites, recreational facilities and other tourist preference facilities to maximize economic outcome. This reorganization limits or does not accommodate residential use, especially of farm workers, (i) due to security concerns of dangerous wild animals such as lions, leopards and cheetah, (ii) the need to conserve biodiversity, hence keep the land use as purely conservational, (iii) almost irreversible mind shift, political and management configurations that have shaped game farming in South Africa.</p>","<p style='text-align: justify;'>Interviews by Achieng (2018) revealed that decision by farmers to convert from livestock to game farming was primarily influenced by a six-year drought that occurred between 1989-1995. The prolonged drought led to the drying up of the Bushman&rsquo;s River, along with other water sources that sustained livestock on the farms. The quality and quantity of cultivated and natural pasture for livestock was also reduced by the drought. As a result, the market value of livestock products declined in quality and quantity (Jones <em>et al</em>., 2005; Smith &amp; Wilson, 2002). The resulting economic pressures influenced the farmers decision to convert their pastoral land into game farms.</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>Farmers&rsquo; decision to shift into game farming was profit driven and included the fear of losing land to communities through expropriation as part of the ongoing national process of land reform in South Africa. According to Achieng <em>et al.</em>, (2020), &nbsp;change to game farming was a &lsquo;selfish&rsquo; act, related to individual farmers&rsquo; fear of sharing or losing their land. This positively reinforced farmer&rsquo;s &lsquo;greed&rsquo; and increased their desire to adopt game farming as a strategy to legitimize their position as game farmers. The shift to game farming also centred around the conservation benefits of game farming industry. Landowners saw game farming practice as a sustainable land use that increases the protected area estate and contributes to the conservation of biodiversity.</p>","<p style='text-align: justify;'>The incremental adoption of game farming in the Eastern cape catalysed the spread of ideas and motivations for this model. Soon, neighbouring farms such as Shamwari Game Reserve, started converting their pastoral land into game farms. These new farms&rsquo; success, which was perceived to be generating more profit, made game farming increasingly attractive to the surrounding neighbours. As farm conversion gradually spread among livestock farmers in the areas, the idea of an increased tourism industry in the Eastern Cape was strengthened, and thus reinforced the possibility of landowners to shift to game farming. As a result, eight neighbouring livestock farms in Amakhala were amalgamated to create the Amakhala Conservation Centre in 1999. With the conversion into a game farm, game species were introduced including cheetah, buffalo, elephant (Maciejewski &amp; Kerley, 2014) and different types of antelope. Old houses were converted into lodges and Amakhala became an ecotourism operating game reserve, with eight lodges and camping facilities. Services offered by these private reserves have since attracted a number of domestic (ECPTA, 2018) and international tourists (Acheampong, 2015), ranking Eastern Cape as the third most visited province in South Africa by 2018 (ECPTA, 2018).</p>","<p style='text-align: justify;'>According to Achieng <em>et al.</em>, (2020), the shift from livestock farms into game farms changed the nature of ecosystem service provision in terms of quality and quantity, and accessibility and availability. It led to a decrease in provision of food from livestock and gardens, wood fuel, and game meat. Spiritual practices however remained consistent in both land uses, although churches were moved to different locations within the game farms. &nbsp;</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>Socially, the establishment of game farms radically altered the networks of social relations attached to these places (Achieng <em>et al.</em>, 2020; Mkhize, 2014). The livestock farms were seen as homes to most farmworkers, a place that allowed social networks to be established, which was integral to their sense of community. Worker residents were moved off game farms in towns, which meant they had to commute to work each day. As a result, there were lost valued social networks that strengthened community bonds, lost homes and security to the land, through erection of fences.</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>Game farms as land uses have more economic activities (Paul &amp; Rashid, 2017) and gains generated from tourist activities (Brandt &amp; Spierenburg, 2014). The economic benefits contributed to individual financial wellbeing and may extend beyond the reserve. The increase in profit generated from the game farm sector contributes to the GDP of the province, as affirmed by Maciejewski (2012), a benefit that according a provincial report, extends beyond the scale of the reserve and may be counted at a national scale (ECPTA, 2018; KO, 2015). According to Achieng <em>et al.</em>, (2020), the economic gains were also important to both landowners and farmworkers at varied levels, and contributed to their financial wellbeing (Brandt &amp; Spierenburg 2014).</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>In terms of gender impacts, change in economic status was most apparent among women workers. While women&rsquo;s incomes may have increased, their socially prescribed roles as family carers and household managers did not change. This aligns with studies of the gender of paid and unpaid labour worldwide and across socio-economic categories - when women take on paid work often their unpaid labour - caring for families, does not decrease, resulting in an increase in their overall labour demands (WEF, 2015; Knudsen &amp; W&aelig;rness, 2008). According to Achieng <em>et al.</em>, (2020), women testified that their domestic duties did not decrease, even though their work duties in the game farm regime increased. While men&rsquo;s paid work duties may have changed with the regime change, there was no indication that they took on previously female gendered roles in the household even though women took on additional paid work, along with their usual unpaid duties.</p>","<p style='text-align: justify;'>Regime shifts in social-ecological systems can present new forms of social narratives that can be constructed for a socially functioning society. To better manage the transition from livestock to game farming for all land users, Achieng (2018) suggests that &nbsp;it is imperative to foster good and transparent relationships between ecosystem users in the process of change. This is in reference to major decisions of operations, especially those that significantly alter their living conditions. Cr&eacute;pin <em>et al</em>., &nbsp;(2012) also allude to better ways of navigating such transitions, including understanding context of different ecosystem stakeholders and asking questions of who the regime shift is significant to and diverse impacts it has on different ecosystem users.</p>","(#1) Acheampong, K. 2015.

"404","2020-05-26 00:00:00","Bimodal agrarian system to trimodal agrarian system","Nyasha Magadzire","Linda Luvuno, Therezah Achieng","<p>In 2000 the Zimbabwean government initiated the Fast Track Land Reform program which sought to address historical injustices and racial imbalances in the ownership of land stemming from the colonial era (Moyo, 2011a). Under the Fast Track Land Reform program, over 10 million hectares of land were redistributed amongst 146 000 smallholder farm families and 23&nbsp;000 medium-scale farms (Scoones, Mavedzenge, Murimbarimba &amp; Sukume, 2018), with the small holder farms (A1 resettlements) and medium scale farms (A2 resettlements), averaging a size of 6ha and 10-300ha, respectively (Muchetu, 2019). &nbsp;The Land Reform Program resulted in a dramatic shift in agrarian structure where a bi-modal system of 6000 large scale commercial farms and over one million communal small-scale peasant farms were transformed into a trimodal agrarian structure of small, medium and large farms (Moyo, 2009; Scoones <em>et al.</em>, 2018). This restructuring of the Zimbabwean agrarian system presents ongoing socio-economic and ecological implication. The reconfiguration of Zimbabwe`s agrarian structure shifted agricultural production from exports to diverse food crops. The shift in agrarian structure enhanced the livelihoods of the resettled farmers as they now had access to quality land and opportunities to engage in off-farm activities. The establishment of new farmers on redistributed land had ecological implications such as deforestation and decreased land for wild carnivores.</p>","Bimodal agrarian system to trimodal agrarian system","Agro-ecosystems","Small-scale subsistence crop cultivation, Large-scale commercial crop cultivation","Sub-continental/regional (e.g. southern Africa, Amazon basin)","Africa","Southern Africa","Zimbabwe","","Small-scale subsistence crop cultivation, Large-scale commercial crop cultivation","Agro-ecosystems","Soil formation, Primary production","Biodiversity","Food crops, Wild animal and plant products, Woodfuel","Regulation of soil erosion","Spiritual and religious","Food and nutrition, Livelihoods and economic activity, Security of housing & infrastructure","No poverty, Zero hunger, Industry, innovation & infrastructure, Reduced inequalities","National (country)","Years","Unknown","Contemporary observations","Well established – Wide agreement in the literature that the RS exists","Contested – Multiple proposed mechanisms, reasonable evidence both for and against different mechanisms","<p><strong>Bi-modal agrarian structure</strong>:</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>Before 2000, two major classes of farmers existed in Zimbabwe: 4500-6000 large-scale commercial farmers (LSCF) who were mostly white, owning an average of 1754ha of land each, and one million black small-scale peasant farmers on communal lands with an average farm size of 18ha (Moyo, 2011b; Scoones <em>et al.</em>, 2018). The LSCFs were largely located on prime agricultural land and devoted to growing crops for export (e.g. tobacco), while the small communal farms, mostly located in low productivity regions, produced cheap foods (e.g. maize, beans and groundnuts) for subsistence and domestic markets (Chambati, 2011; Moyo, 2011a). The success of large-scale commercial farming in Zimbabwe hinged on the ability to access finance from local and foreign institutions; heavy investments into electrification, irrigation systems and road infrastructure and well-established links to export markets.</p> <p><strong>Tri-modal agrarian structure: </strong></p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>As a result of the FTLRP, Zimbabwe`s pre-2000 agrarian structure was transformed in a broader based trimodal system. This new structure consisted of smallholder/peasant farms, medium-scale farms and large-scale farms (Moyo, Chambati, Siziba, Dangwa, Mujeyi &amp; Nyoni, 2009; Scoones <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Smallholder farms account for over 70% of Zimbabwe`s agricultural land and consist of communal area households, old resettlement households and A1 households (Moyo, 2011c; Scoones, Marongwe, Mavedzenge, Murimbarimba, Mahenehene &amp; Sukume, 2011). The A1 households are small plots that were set aside for landless and poor families, for subsistence cropping and grazing (Moyo, 2011b). The medium-scale farms cover 13% of the land and are made up of small-scale commercial farms and A2 farms (Moyo, 2011c). These A2 farms were designed for beneficiaries who possess the &nbsp;farming skills and/or resources required to engage in commercial farming (Moyo, 2011b). Large scale farms and estates now only account for 11% of Zimbabwe`s agricultural land.</p>","<p style='text-align: justify;'>Political expediency is commonly cited as the main driver behind the implementation of the FTLRP which led to the swift and radical transformation of Zimbabwe`s agrarian structure (Logan, 2007; Sachikonye, 2003; Shonhe, 2019). In the years leading up to the initiation of the FTLRP in 2000, the ruling party, Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), was losing popularity as supporters began to agitate for the acceleration of the redistribution of land (Murisa, 2011; Sadomba, 2008). In addition, the rise of the opposition party, Movement of Democratic Change (MDC), furthered ZANU-PF`s concerns over losing favor with its supporters. Seeking to maintain power, the government initiated the FTLRP (Sachikonye, 2003). By 2009, 10 million hectares of land previously owned by large scale farmers had been acquired for redistribution, and less than 400 white LSCF were left in Zimbabwe (Moyo, 2011c).</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>However, the core issues that necessitated the redistribution of land in Zimbabwe cannot be overlooked. There was a great need for dismantling the racially skewed distribution of land in Zimbabwe, not only for the purposes of equity and righting colonial injustices, but also for addressing land shortages and poverty (Mutopo, Manjengwa &amp; Chiweshe, 2014). The legacy of the Land Act of 1969, which assigned black people to subsist on infertile and overcrowded communal lands, while a minority of LSCF held large tracts of fertile land, still existed 20 years after Zimbabwe`s independence. Redistributing land offered a means by which a more equitable agrarian structure could be achieved.</p>","<p style='text-align: justify;'>Preceding the implementation of the FTLRP in 2000, land reform in Zimbabwe had been taking place in accordance to the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979. The LHA stipulated that: 1) for the next 10 years land could not be forcibly taken from LSCF, 2) land could only be acquired on a &lsquo;willing seller, willing buyer&rsquo; basis, and 3) Britain would provide funds and arrange donor support to finance the redistribution of land in Zimbabwe (Logan, 2007). The aim of land reform at this stage was to redistribute 8,3 million hectares of land to 162&nbsp;000 households (Shonhe, 2019). However, the realisation of this aim was met with challenges as the land parcels offered by the white farmers were expensive, small and fragmented, and mostly located in infertile agroecological regions (Logan, 2007). Added to that, was the lack of political will from the government and the absence of organised pressure from the peasants and landless to ensure that the targets of the land reform were achieved (Sachikonye, 2003). As of 1998 only 3,5 million hectares out of the targeted 8,3 million hectares had been redistributed to 71&nbsp;000 households (Government of Zimbabwe, 2002).</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>A combination of mounting pressure from the ground up, and the emergence of the Movement for Democratic Change spurred the government into accelerating the process of land redistribution. Overcrowding and growing poverty in the communal areas, juxtapositioned against the growth of a state-supported black elite class, led to a more concerted agitation for land by war veterans, traditional leaders and peasants (Murisa, 2011; Sachikonye, 2003; Sadomba, 2008). Concerned with losing its stronghold of electoral support (i.e. the rural community and war veterans) and the growing popularity of MDC, the ruling party hastily implemented the FTLRP in July 2000 (Shonhe, 2019). Within a year, 11,200 black families were resettled on to 3.2 million hectares of acquired land (Logan, 2007). By 2009, the Zimbabwean government had redistributed 10 million hectares of land amongst 146 000 households under the FTLRP, marking the final transition of Zimbabwe`s dualistic agrarian system into a broad-based tri-modal system (Logan, 2007; Moyo, 2011c).</p>","<p style='text-align: justify;'>As expected, the radical reconfiguration of Zimbabwe`s agrarian structure led to a transitional decline in agricultural production. Between 2001 and 2009 there was a decline in commercially grown crops such as tobacco, tea, coffee and wheat (Moyo, 2011b; Scoones <em>et al.</em>, 2011). Tobacco , for example, had fallen from 200 million kilograms per annum to 48,7 million kilograms per annum by 2008 (Scoones <em>et al.</em>, 2018). On the other hand, maize production, largely driven by peasant farmers, decreased as a result of recurrent droughts and inconsistent supply of seed and fertilizer. However, due to the expansion of food grain producers (i.e. the peasantry), the output and cropped area of sorghum and millet increased. The production of other food crops such as groundnuts and beans also increased. Ultimately, the reconfiguration of Zimbabwe`s agrarian structure shifted agricultural production from exports to diverse food crops (Moyo, 2011b).</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>The shift in agrarian structure enhanced the livelihoods of the resettled farmers as they now had access to quality land and opportunities to engage in off-farm activities (e.g. mining and fishing) for income (Chambati, 2011). Furthermore, some were able to access their ancestral lands and graves as well as other locations of spiritual significance (Mkodzongi, 2013). With regards to gender, the FTLRP enabled women to gain direct access to land, rather than through patriarchal structures such as male relatives and village heads (Mkodzongi &amp; Lawrence, 2019). Land tenure, however, has proven to be a major stumbling block in accessing agro-finance and export markets for the resettled farmers. In place of title deeds, the Zimbabwean government awarded offer letters to A1 farmers and 99-year lease agreements to A2 farmers for their newly acquired land (World Bank, 2019). Banks and other finance institutions are reluctant to accept this form of tenure as collateral and therefore decline applications for finance from resettled farmers (Munangagwa, 2011). This has given rise to contract farming whereby international or domestic merchants provide inputs and management services to farmers to grow a crop. The merchant will then buy the produce from the farmer and deduct the cost of the inputs supplied (Shonhe, 2019). In contract farming the risk of crop failure is transferred to the farmer which tends to trap the farmer in a cycle of debt (Mkodzongi &amp; Lawrence, 2019).</p> <p style='text-align: justify;'>The establishment of new farmers on redistributed land also has ecological implications. The extraction of woody vegetation for energy, building and cultivation, is leading to deforestation in resettlement areas (Moyo <em>et al.</em>, 2009). Meanwhile, a study by Williams, (2011) highlights the case of human-wildlife conflicts in resettlement areas that has led to a 70% decline in cheetah population in Zimbabwe, this decline was attributed to habitat loss and fragmentation, and poaching. In Gutu District, Zembe, Mbokochena, Mudzengerere &amp; Chikwiri (2014) observed severe soil erosion as a result of overgrazing and river siltation stemming from poor farming practices.</p>","<p style='text-align: justify;'>Going forward, revising the land tenure rights of resettled farmers will be essential for boosting agricultural output through access to agro-finance and stimulating their participation in growing for export. Clear, well defined property rights have also been found to be correlated with good farming practices and environmental stewardship. Investments into electrification and housing infrastructure for resettlement areas may also reduce the exploitation of natural resources.</p>","(#1) Magadzire N, Achieng T & Luvuno L. 2020.

However, an invasive alien fungus known as chestnut blight (<em>Cryphonectria parasitica</em>) was accidently introduced to New York in the early 1900s at a time of significantly increased global trade. American chestnut trees had no resistance to this Asian fungus and it spread rapidly across the eastern coast. By the 1930s it had reached the southern Application forests in Virginia and North Carolina and killed almost all chestnut trees in the area (Anagnostikas, 1982; Freinkel, 2007). It continued to spread further into South Carolina and Georgia. By the mid-1950s over 3.6 million hectares of chestnuts trees, almost the entire population, were dead or dying (Anagnostikas, 1987). Only about 1 % of chestnuts now remain, mainly as small coppiced shrubs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The loss of chestnut trees in the USA had significant negative impacts on the supply of timber, tannins, fodder and food products, negatively impacting the livelihoods of foresters and local communities as well and native biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (Freinkel, 2007). It resulted in the loss of a key food and shelter sources for wild animals in the region and altered nutrient cycles (Smock and McGregor, 1988; Ellison et al. 2005). For up to 50 years many forests in the eastern US had large gaps.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Hickory filled in these gaps over time and became the dominant forest species (McCormick and Platt, 1980). Due to exclusion of fire in the mid to late 1900s, red maple outcompeted hickory and is now the dominate forest species in the Appellation area.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Historically a number of techniques have been used to try and manage chestnut blight invasion, but the majority have failed. This included spaying of fungicide that did not work, and the use of biological control that had limited success. More recently genetic modification and breeding techniques are being implemented to produce chestnut blight resistant strains of <em>C. dentate </em>(Milgroom and Cortesi, 2004; Jacobs, 2007).

Furthermore, exclusion of natural fires has aided red maple to become dominant over other tree species along the eastern parts of the USA, in particular in the Appellations.</p>","<p>This regime shift had many negative impacts on ecosystem services. Negative effects on provisioning services include loss of timber, food, tannin production, and livestock fodder (Anagnostikas, 1987). The loss of chestnut trees has also resulted in altered water and soil nutrient cycling, and resulted in the loss of carbon sequestration potential (Ellison et al. 2005). The American chestnuts provided many cultural services, including aesthetic and spiritual values. The American chestnut had always been a tree that American citizens closely identified with (Anagnostikas, 1987; Freinkel, 2007).</p> <p>These negative impacts of chestnut blight had substantial costs for local livelihoods and human well-being. This included the loss of livelihood strategies and income for people in the timber, tannin and nut production industry. Nuts were also commonly collected and traded (bartered) for other supplies especially by poorer households (Anagnostikas, 1987). It has also resulted in a negative change for cultural identity and loss of cultural practices, as chestnut trees were a popular ornamental, collecting of nuts was a cultural tradition for families, and the tree was symbolic for many Americans.</p>","<p>A number of actions were implemented to try and manage the impact of chestnut blight fungus. This included spraying of fungicide and quarantining and destroying infected trees. However, this did not work effectively. There was also attempted use of biological control for the chestnut blight fungus using a hypovirulence agent. This had mixed success, working well in some regions but not in others (Milgroom and Cortesi, 2004).

Following a regime shift in the North Atlantic in 1995, similar structural changes are now occurring in Arctic waters. Rapid warming of atmospheric and oceanic temperatures has caused a near year-on-year decline in the extent and thickness of summer sea ice since 1979 (NSIDC 2014). Anthropogenic climatic change has extended the growing season and delayed August freeze-up through a decline in albedo reflectivity and enhanced wind-driven vertical mixing. Natural modes of variability at the lower latitudes has also led to poleward shifts of temperate marine species and caused pronounced phenological changes to primary producers. The difference in the temporal scale of these forcing mechanisms makes it hard to predict which event is causing changes to PP. It is uncertain what impact this change will have on the food web of this ecosystem.</p>","","Marine & coastal, Rock and Ice","Fisheries","Sub-continental/regional (e.g. southern Africa, Amazon basin)","Arctic Ocean","Arctic ocean","Norway, United Kingdom, Canada, Iceland","External inputs (eg fertilizers), Environmental shocks (eg floods), Global climate change","Fisheries","Marine & coastal, Rock and Ice","Primary production, Nutrient cycling","Biodiversity","Fisheries, Wild animal and plant products","Climate regulation, Natural hazard regulation","Recreation, Aesthetic values, Knowledge and educational values","Food and nutrition, Health (eg toxins, disease), Livelihoods and economic activity, Cultural, aesthetic and recreational values","","Sub-continental/regional","Unknown","Irreversible (on 100 year time scale)","Models, Paleo-observation, Contemporary observations","Contested – Reasonable evidence both for and against the existence of RS","Contested – Multiple proposed mechanisms, reasonable evidence both for and against different mechanisms","<p>Anthropogenic climate change is largely responsible for the observed changes in the Arctic Ocean over the last few decades (Dicks et al. 2011). The Arctic thermal, hydrological, climatological and biological changes are highly interconnected and the system dynamics are poorly understood insulated from each other (Hinzman et al. 2005). Precisely how the changes in the biological conditions will affect the food web system in the Arctic Ocean is unknown; however, it is evident that people depending on Arctic fish for their livelihoods will be effected in the short term (ibid), while in the longer term, changes might profoundly affect commercial fish stocks in the lower latitudes (Hassan et al. 2005).</p> <p><strong>Polar regime</strong></p> <p>The polar regime is characterized by long winters of 7-10 months (Hinzman et al. 2005). The large extent of year-round sea ice reinforce the albedo effect exhibited at these latitudes, keeping the system in a state of low primary productivity. The ice melt in summer allows phytoplankton to reproduce and provide energy for the dominant cold-loving zooplankton species <em>Calanus hyperboreus</em> and <em>C. glacialis </em>(Ardyna et al. 2014).</p> <p><strong>Temperate regime</strong></p> <p>Summer air temperatures over the Arctic have continued to increase since 1800 (Dicks et al. 2011). The associated decline in sea ice extent and thickness has allowed light to penetrate the upper water column, while the exposure of year-round sea water has increased storminess and the upwelling of nutrients. In some cases, this has led to two annual bloom events and an extent of single annual blooms in areas previously characterized by flat patterns at the sea-ice boundary (Ardyna et al. 2014).</p>","<p>Global warming is well documented as the main driver of warmer air temperatures over the Arctic (Dicks et al. 2011). Warming is causing sea ice to melt and is extending the amount of year-round and seasonal open water (Ardyna et al. 2014). This darker surface is reducing albedo reflexivity and increasing sea surface temperatures (SST). The IPCC AR5 states that warming must be kept below 1&deg;C to prevent irreversible changes of the Arctic system.</p> <p>Natural variations in Arctic SST are observed through Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) internal forcing mechanisms, both modes of climate variability that originate in the lower latitudes. The latter enhances westerly winds, while the combination of both the NAO and a positive AMO enhance ocean advection and storm events (Schlesinger &amp; Ramankutty 1994). This phase of activity has been observed since the mid-1990s, enhancing the poleward movement of warm, saline waters to the eastern Arctic (Chylek et al. 2009).</p> <p>The amount of water masses entering into the Arctic is highly influenced by the strength of Subpolar gyre (H&aacute;t&uacute;n et al. 2009), which itself is influenced by the AMO mode. Since 1995, the North Atlantic Subpolar gyre has been weakening (H&auml;kkinen &amp; Rhines 2004). Together, the AMO and Subpolar gyre have enhanced the observed melting of sea ice in the Arctic and the calving events of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) (Straneo &amp; Heinback 2009). However, freshwater inflow from Greenland and Siberian runoff reduces the density of the water column and enhances stratification with the denser saline layer below. It is uncertain how this inflow might counter the observed increase in bloom events, but a change in Siberian forest cover could enhance nutrient inputs and thus promote further PP, where rates of PP have already increased by 135% from 1998 to 2009 (Frey et al. 2007).</p>","<p>The polar region is characterized by relatively low rates of precipitation and two distinct seasons (Hinzman et al. 2005). The winter season, lasting for 7-10 months, displays a large sea-ice extent, maintained through an ice-albedo feedback (Curry et al. 1995). During the summer, the sea ice retreats and allows for PP to occur in areas where light can penetrate the water column (Ardyna et al. 2014). These conditions are especially beneficial for the cold-loving zooplankton species <em>Calanus hyperboreus </em>and<em> C. glacialis</em>. They successfully convert phytoplankton into energy-dense marine lipid, and thus play a vital role in sustaining the higher trophic levels of the Arctic ecosystem (Falk-Petersen et al. 2007). In September the annual freeze-up begins.</p> <p>The ocean and atmosphere work together to drive currents around the planet. At the interface, this heat flux causes the development of trade winds and storm events. This interaction is amplified as the sea ice melts and - coupled with warmer air temperatures - it increases storminess and vertical mixing in the upper layers of the water column. Such turbulence brings nutrients and heavier phytoplankton to the surface, promoting suitable conditions for PP. This coupling has intensified with more ice-free waters in the summer months and led to an upward trend in the length of the growing season (Frey et al. 2007).&nbsp;Since 1995, the positive modes of variation along with a weak Subpolar gyre and strong density-driven Thermohaline conveyor (THC), have favoured the poleward movement of warmer waters (H&aacute;t&uacute;n et al. 2009), bringing warm-water-loving species (eg. herring) north and contracting the range of cold-water-loving species, such as the zooplankton <em>C. finimarchicus</em>, northwards. These mechanisms are amplifying the effect of anthropogenic forcing in the Arctic Ocean but it is unsure how they, in turn, will be affected by climate change in the future (H&aacute;t&uacute;n et al. 2005).</p> <p>The temperate regime is characterised by two annual phytoplankton bloom events. The Arctic Ocean is the least productive of all the oceans, but as permanent ice cover and stratification has declined, primary productivity has increased (Ardyna et al. 2014). A delay in the annual freeze-up event due to warmer SST has lengthened the growing season. Phenological changes in the timing of blooms, advancing by as much as 50 days between 1997 to 2009, has allowed for double bloom events characteristic of more temperate climates and a compositional shift towards the dominance of smaller phytoplankton species (Li et al. 2009). Earlier melting is increasing nutrient-rich freshwater inputs from coastal shelves, such as Siberia and Greenland, while oceanic systems are driving nutrient-rich waters from the lower latitudes (Ardyna et al. 2014). Together, these processes act to maintain the Arctic in a temperate state.</p>","<p><strong>Shift from polar regime to temperate regime </strong></p> <p>Ice-dependent species with limited distribution, specialised feeding habits and predator avoidance (Post et al. 2009), such as cod, shrimp, marine mammals and seabirds, have seen changes in abundance due to warmer temperatures and changes in their ecosystems (Wasmann 2011). In contrast, warm-loving species are thriving due to rising SST and food abundance (H&aacute;t&uacute;n et al. 2009). Nevertheless, in the long term a shift in food-web composition and diversity could diminish the resilience of the Arctic system by the invasion of non-native species, eutrophication or the spread of disease thus decreasing the recreational and aesthetic value of these ecosystems (Niiranen et al. 2014).</p> <p><br />Due to their highly adapted way of life, the loss of provisioning ES could indirectly impact indigenous wellbeing and livelihoods (Arctic Council 2013). Contrarily, this shift to a temperate regime could bring shorter-term gains to tourism (eg. whale watching) and commercial fishing, helped by easier navigation in ice-free waters, although the benefit will be felt by mainly non-Arctic residents (Hassan et al. 2005). Human health is at risk due to the consumption of high level fish and mammal from the Arctic by the bioaccumulation of pollutants (Butler and Oluoch-Kosura 2006). Changes in the Arctic will also have spillover effects in Atlantic waters, reducing PP and food provisioning (Arctic Council 2013).</p>","<div class='rs-more-info'> <div class='value'> <div id='fab__rs_details___Options_for_managing_the_regime_shift_ro' class='fabrikElementReadOnly'> <p>From the point of view of PP, it is unclear how the regime shift would affect the ecosystem and the services people derive from it (Moore &amp; Huntington 2008; Greene et al. 2008; Li et al. 2011). However, the regime shift is connected to other changes with possibly catastrophic implications, such as reduced Albedo negatively influencing the Arctic Ocean&rsquo;s temperature regulating ability, or the loss of habitat for Arctic-specific species. Considering these implications of a regime shift, from a global perspective polar conditions are clearly preferable.</p> <p>It is essential to cut global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) in order to prevent further sea ice loss and the kicking-in of feedback mechanisms that risk putting the Arctic in a permanent temperate state. Equally important is to prevent deforestation, as this reduces the biosphere&rsquo;s ability to sequester atmospheric carbon. Especially important, in the polar region, ceased deforestation could reduce primary production by decreasing the discharge of nutrients into the Arctic Ocean. For carrying this out, international agreements on emissions and land use are necessary. However, it might not be enough to prevent a regime shift considering observed changes and the time lag of global climate processes. Management options for reversing the regime shift are essentially the same as for preventing it, but a reversal is likely to take a long time, as several feedback mechanisms will drive the system towards temperate conditions.</p> <p>Although highly criticised, geoengineering has been proposed as a way to speed up the reversal of the regime shift (Heckendorn et al. 2009). A scheme often put forward is to reflect some solar radiation back into space by introducing aerosols into the stratosphere. Though economically viable, this is highly controversial due to its ethically challenging nature, the many possible ecological side effects and the impossibility to reverse action once implemented.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div id='rs-refs'><form class='refs' action='http://www.regimeshifts.org/item/581-primary-production-in-the-arctic-ocean' method='post' name='refs'></form></div>","(#1) Aagaard, K., Carmarck, E.C., 1989.

A phenomenon that could occur in areas with similar conditions throughout the Arctic. Regional, but also a local regime shifts will have social-ecological effects due to trophic cascades through the food-web&nbsp;(Grebmeier et al. 2006)&nbsp;with potential consequences for the local low-density human population of Svalbard and for commercial fisheries operating in the area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>With increasing light availability and an increase in sea surface temperature (SST) caused by climate change, the Arctic climate zone will become more similar to subarctic conditions and thus promote species that thrive in these regions. It has been proposed that erect macroalgae will benefit from these novel conditions (Bischoff and Wiencke 1993) thus causing a borealisation of the Arctic benthos.</p> <p><strong>Arctic benthos (regime 1)</strong></p> <p>With local variation in species composition, the substrate in Kongsfjord was dominated by sea anemones and red calcareous algae, whereas Smeerenburgfjord consisted of red calcareous algae and several different filter feeders such as sea anemones, sea squirts and barnacles (Kortsch et al. 2012). According to Johansen (1981), the dominating species was the red calcareous algae (<em>Lithothamnion sp.</em>) that thrives in low light and low SST.</p> <p><strong>Subarctic benthos (regime 2)</strong></p> <p>After the regime shift had occurred, the species composition was more characteristic to subarctic regions (Kortsch et al. 2012). In Kongsfjord, brown algae cover increased from 8% to 80% in 1996 and thereafter fluctuated around 40%, whereas in 2000 the benthos in Smeerenburgfjord consisted of several brown and red macroalgae species (Kortsch et al. 2012). The species found in this new borealised state (e.g. <em>Desmarestia sp.</em>) generally have high light and temperature requirements (Bischoff and Wiencke 1993).</p>","<p>The two key drivers regulating the regime shift in the Arctic benthos are sea ice cover and sea surface temperature (Kortsch et al. 2012). Over the last few decades, there has been a simultaneous increase in sea surface temperature and in the length of the ice-free season in the region (Kortsch et al. 2012), which Beuchel et al<em>.</em> (2006) explain as effects of global warming and changing patterns of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). NAO is a large-scale climatic phenomenon that regulates atmospheric circulation across the North Atlantic, and its changing patterns have led to larger inflows of warm currents in the studied region (Beuchel, Gulliksen, and Carroll 2006). Changing NAO patterns are likely to affect the climatic conditions in different ways in different regions of the Arctic (AICA 2005), which makes it hard to generalize the impacts in benthic structure on a regional scale.</p> <p>The reduced sea ice cover in the fjords enhances the light conditions in the water column, which, coupled with higher SST, promotes reproduction and growth of erect, boreal macroalgae that thrive under conditions with higher temperature and more light (Bischoff and Wiencke 1993). Correspondingly, the red calcareous algae that dominates in the Arctic regime is disfavoured by the changed conditions as it thrives under low light and low temperature conditions (Kortsch et al. 2012).</p>","<p>In the Arctic regime with low light and low temperature conditions, red calcareous algae and filter feeders such as sea anemones dominate the substrate cover. Although macroalgae exist in this regime, they are largely outrivaled in the competition for space (Kortsch et al. 2012). The red calcareous algae control macroalgae settling by an antifouling mechanism of sloughing outer layers, which inhibits overgrowth (Kortsch et al. 2012). Further, the red calcareous algae excrete chemicals that attract grazers feeding on macroalgae. In other words, the dominating processes in the Arctic benthos regime are grazing and competition for space (Kortsch et al. 2012)</p> <p>Increasing SST and increasing light availability in the water column - conditions that favor macroalgae while negatively impacting the red calcareous algae (Bischoff and Wiencke 1993; Johansen 1981) - promotes a change in benthic community structure. Higher growth rates among macroalgae reduce the effectiveness of the above-mentioned control mechanisms (Kortsch et al. 2012). Further, dense carpets of erect macroalgae can limit the food availability for the sea anemones, and might mechanically interfere with feeding (Beuchel et al. 2006). If macroalgae begins to cover the sea anemones, an energetic cost will result from cleaning off algae, which may reduce its competitive strength (Beuchel et al. 2006). At a certain point, the macroalgae are able to outcompete the previously dominating species, and the system shifts into a new state.</p> <p>Once the macroalgae has established, the new regime is maintained by the processes of competition for space, including interference with feeding, limiting food availability and overgrowth. Consequently, the same feedbacks operating in the Arctic regime are also active in the subarctic regime, but with a shifted balance of more macroalgae as they are more competitive under the new environmental conditions.&nbsp;</p> <p>Historical data shows that a somewhat similar benthic regime shift occurred after a warming period in the 1920s and 1930s, leading to a change in benthic community structure with higher abundance of macroalgae. The subarctic regime lasted for several decades, before returning to the Arctic state (Drinkwater 2006). This indicates that the regime shift seen in the Svalbard fjords might be reversible, given that SST and light availability declines. It is, however, not likely that the process of climate change in the Arctic will be reversed in the near future (IPCC 2013), which might lessen the likelihood of a reversal.</p>","<p>Benthos plays an important role in marine ecosystems, as food and habitat provider for marine organisms such as commercial fish species (Snelgrove 1999). The shift from Arctic to subarctic benthos could lead to large ecosystem changes that affect provisioning (e.g. food and wild animal products), recreational, and aesthetic ecosystem services. On a local scale, the regime shift led to higher local biodiversity (Kortsch et al. 2012), and will potentially lead to larger fish stocks and more primary production, e.g. more carbon cycling (Grebmeier et al. 2006; Snelgrove 1999). Regionally, biodiversity could decrease due to homogenisation of different ecosystems (Weslawski et al. 2011). If, and how, recreational and aesthetic service provision will change as a result of the regime shift is uncertain.</p> <p>The potential increase in fish stocks in the subarctic regime would be beneficial for the commercial fishing industry that operates near Svalbard, and the consumers that enjoy their products. Carbon cycling is beneficial on a global scale, but the local contribution to global carbon cycling is negligible. Trophic cascades could affect local livelihoods and tourists if recreational ecosystem services are changed, and effects can be both increase and decrease in human well-being.&nbsp;</p>","<p>Since the main drivers of the regime shift are caused by global warming, decreasing the greenhouse gas emissions to reduce atmospheric temperatures is arguable the most powerful point of intervention. This is, however, a management option associated with several difficulties: a) any serious attempt to deal with climate change would have to be on a global scale, involving a multitude of nations and stakeholders, which so far has proven a difficult task, b) due to time lags in the climate system the borealisation of the benthos could occur in more places across the Arctic than what has been observed, even with successful greenhouse gas reduction, and c) the new regime dominated by macroalgae could be stable, and just reversing or slowing down the effects of global warming might not be enough to push the system back into the first regime.</p> <p>Any local scale management options aimed to successfully inhibit the borealisation are hard to find due to the global and regional processes that are driving the regime shift. Realising the fact that there are going to be continued changes, taking an adaptive management approach in handling this ecosystem might be the best local management option. Adaptive management is often suggested when facing uncertainty, and its goal is to reduce these uncertainties over time, but also to continuously learn more about the system (Holling 1978). In Svalbard this could mean ecosystem monitoring and research with the goal of increasing knowledge about the Arctic benthos, which would enable decision-making based on up-to-date information about the state of the system. Svalbard can be considered unique in its management conditions, since there is a symbiotic relationship between the tourism industry, research activities and governing institutions (Viken 2010), something that could provide good opportunities for an adaptive management approach.</p>","(#1)  Holling, C.

Firstly, there is a lack of native aquatic plant species to occupy the water column and compete for resources. Secondly they are often eutrophic systems, caused by anthropogenic activity such as intensive agriculture and improper human waste disposal, and nutrient loading is a known driver of invasive plants. Also, it has been argued that the intrinsic nature of freshwater systems leads them to be disproportionately affected by non native invasive species when compared with terrestrial systems (Moorhouse and McDonald 2015).</p> <p>This combination has lead to a long battle against floating invasive plants that dominate many of South Africa&rsquo;s freshwater resources.. These plants form dense mats on the waters surface, restricting light to other species, damaging hydroelectric equipment, limiting water quality and reducing biodiversity. They can also play host to vectors of disease such as malari and schistosomiasis (Mack and Smith, 2011). The implementation of classical biological control programs, using the natural enemies of the invasive plants, has proven to be a huge success when controlling detrimental invasive plants such as water hyacinth (<em>Eichhornia crassipes)</em>, water lettuce (<em>Pistia stratiotes</em> L. (Araceae)), Kariba weed (<em>Salvinia molesta </em>D.S. Mitchell (Salviniaceae)), parrots feather (<em>Myriophyllum aquaticum </em>(Vellozo Concei&ccedil;&atilde;o) Verdcourt) and red water fern (<em>Azolla filiculoides </em>Lamarck (Azollaceae)) (Hill 2002)</p> <p>The host-specific biological control agents (BCAs), typically insects and mites, have coevolved with the plants in their natural range and are intentionally introduced to manage invasive plant populations.</p> <p>The overall aim of this is to induce a regime shift into a functioning system with high native biodiversity and freshwater access. However, we propose that whilst the BCAs do lead to a dramatic reduction in the biomass and health of the floating plant, it can also act as a catalyst inducing a shift into a second degraded stable regime. This second regime is one that is dominated by <em>submerged </em>invasive plants. The establishment of the BCAs on the floating plants can lead to a rapid plant population crash and the nutrients they were locking up are released. At the same time submerged light levels are restored in the water column, enabling a new suite of submerged invasive plants to flourish. The increase in space, light and nutrients promotes the submerged plant growth and as they continue to photosynthesize the levels of dissolved oxygen in the water rise. This improvement in water quality, alongside a limited number of native submerged plants to compete with, helps to establish and maintain this second stable regime (invasive submerged plant dominance). These rooted plants can alter water flow, turbidity and sediment stabilization (Yarrow <em>et al</em>. 2009). They can also degrade water quality and biodiversity, restrict access to freshwater and damage hydro-electrical equipment.</p>","Submerged to Floating Plants","Freshwater lakes & rivers","Urban, Small-scale subsistence crop cultivation, Large-scale commercial crop cultivation, Intensive livestock production (eg feedlots, dairies), Extensive livestock production (natural rangelands), Conservation, Tourism","Local/landscape (e.g. lake, catchment, community)","Africa","South Africa","South Africa","External inputs (eg fertilizers), Species introduction or removal, Environmental shocks (eg floods)","Urban, Small-scale subsistence crop cultivation, Large-scale commercial crop cultivation, Intensive livestock production (eg feedlots), Extensive livestock production (rangelands), Conservation, Tourism","Freshwater lakes & rivers","Nutrient cycling, Water cycling","Biodiversity","Freshwater, Livestock, Fisheries, Hydropower","Water purification, Pest & Disease regulation, Natural hazard regulation","Recreation, Aesthetic values, Knowledge and educational values","Food and nutrition, Health (eg toxins, disease), Livelihoods and economic activity, Cultural, aesthetic and recreational values","","Local/landscape","Years","Unknown","Models, Contemporary observations, Experiments","Speculative – Regime shift has been proposed, but little evidence as yet","Well established – Wide agreement on the underlying mechanism","<p><strong>Invasive floating plant dominance</strong></p> <p>This regime is characterized by dense, mono-specific mats of free-floating invasive plants that cover vast areas of the water&rsquo;s surface. The water below lacks adequate light for many species to survive and biodiversity is restricted. These mats can completely conceal the water-body beneath and as they are free floating they can be displaced by flash floods and strong winds, often damaging hydroelectric equipment and causing a sudden change in ecosystem structure and function.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Invasive submerged plant dominance</strong></p> <p>Dense monocultures of rooted submerged invasive plants dominate the system, often not seen until they reach the water&rsquo;s surface by which point they are usually problematic. Native vegetation is out competed, and whilst initially these plants can push up levels of dissolved oxygen and improve water quality they rapidly grow to a state where only the plants near the waters&rsquo; surface are healthy and just below the water is turbid and hypoxic. Water flow is also limited and pumping mechanisms can become clogged and damaged, increasing flood risk. These plants often reproduce via fragmentation and can easily be spread through river systems by wildlife, people, boats and often by the machines used to mechanically clear the plants from invaded areas.</p>","<p><strong>Shift from floating invasive to submerged invasive plant dominance</strong></p> <p>The main causes of the regime shift, we believe, are the biological control of floating invasive plants in freshwater systems. Nutrients that were previously locked within the floating invasive plants are now available for submerged invasive plants to acquire. Another major factor is the intrinsic nature of these systems, they are man-made and historically not a common feature of South African topography meaning there are fewer native species to readily occupy them. As the floating plants are controlled there may not be a good stock of native submerged plants to utilize the resources and instead resilience is very low in this unstable state. Poorly regulated human activities such as waste water treatment and unregulated agricultural endeavors have also led to problematically high nutrient loading in many of these systems.</p>","<p><strong>Shift from floating invasive to submerged invasive plant dominance</strong></p> <p>The invasive floating plant regime often occurs in man-made, impounded freshwater systems in South Africa. The invasive plants have often been intentionally introduced via the aquarium and ornamental trade, and un-intentionally via &lsquo;hitchhiking&rsquo; on other species and aquatic machinery. In many cases external nutrient loading facilitates their growth and minimizes the impact of biological control agents therefore perpetuating the regime. The floating plants quickly form mats that block light to the water column, which can reduce the presence of other aquatic plants that might compete for resources, again maintaining their dominance. Eventually they can alter the whole ecosystem structure and function diminishing the presence of and access to quality freshwater.</p> <p>Once invasive floating plants are dominant biological control agents may be introduced to control the floating plants, with the hope of inducing a regime shift to a clear water system with healthy biodiversity and good quality water. However, the regime shift we believe is happening in many systems is quite different. As the floating plants decompose dues to the effects of control agents the system receives a sudden influx of freely available nutrients, and at the same time light levels within the water column are restored. As nutrients, light and space become available submerged invasive plants are able to utilize the resources and establish.</p> <p>The submerged plants&rsquo; ability to photosynthesize temporarily increases the levels of dissolved oxygen in the water column thus improving water quality (short-term) and allowing the submerged plants to become dominant. After this period of improvement, the water quality deteriorates as the plant biomass crosses a threshold after which it begins to block out light, reduce biodiversity and alter sediment stability. External nutrient loading further facilitates their growth and helps to sustain the new invasive submerged plant regime.</p>","<p><strong>Shift from floating invasive to submerged invasive plant dominance</strong></p> <p>This regime shift leads to diminished access to quality freshwater. Livelihoods that are dependent on South Africa&rsquo;s freshwater biodiversity, such as fishing and eco-tourism are also compromised (Charles and Dukes, 2007). As are all activities that depend on access to freshwater for irrigation and livestock. Many farmers have lost livestock to drowning as they perceive large mats of floating plants to be solid underfoot (McConnachie et al, 2003). Hydroelectric pumps are damaged, once again limiting water access, and the costs related to repairing these and to the mechanical/chemical control of the submerged plants can be substantial.</p> <p>Besides impacts of economic activities and livelihoods, this regime shift also directly impacts&nbsp;human well-being. Invasive aquatic plants play a key role harboring vectors of diseases such as schistosomiasis (bilharzia) and malaria (Mack and Smith, 2011). Continued mismanagement of invasive plants in South Africa, perpetuated by poor understanding of the systems, leads to incorrect spending of state funding potentially affecting a wider cross-section of people and communities than those directly affected. Protection against natural disasters are also affected, as floods defenses are compromised by the plants which alter water flow and can increase water levels by raising sedimentation.</p>","<p>Potentially, once the dominating invasive submerged plants are controlled (manually, physically or biologically) there could be a shift back to the floating plant dominance if the environmental conditions that facilitated the floating plants have not changed or been managed and if no &lsquo;reserve&rsquo; of the floating plant has been left to support a population of it&rsquo;s bio-control agents.</p> <p>By reducing levels of eutrophication alongside the control of invasive floating plants we can increase resilience against colonization from submerged plants. We also propose that increasing local levels of native vegetation (via seed banks and plant stocking) in systems before the control of the floating plants is underway could increase resilience as there would be less resources available for invasive plants to utilize.</p>","(#1) Charles H & Dukes JS. 2007.

These shrublands have extremely high plant diversity and endemism and the region is listed as one of the world&rsquo;s biodiversity hotspots. Soils are acidic and nutrient poor and intense fires at intervals of 5-15 years are a key driver of ecosystem dynamics (Allsopp, 2014).</p> <p><strong>Invasive tree (Australian wattle) monoculture</strong></p> <p>The introduction, naturalization, and invasion of Australian wattle (Acacia) tree species, especially <em>Acacia cyclops, A. longifolia, A. saligna A. mearnsii</em> in the fynbos biome, has resulted in a shift from a megadiverse shrubland vegetation to landscapes dominated by monocultures of wattles and other invasive trees and shrubs, with the absence or significantly reduced abundance of native species. This has resulted in reduced water flow, altered fire regimes (increased frequency and intensity), and changes in soil nutrient cycles (changes in pH, elevated soil nutrient levels, and the addition of new biotic interactions, e.g. mycorrhiza).</p>","<p>The main driver of the regime shift is the introduction of non-native trees into a virtually treeless environment. In South Africa, numerous Australian wattle species were introduced for a variety of reasons, inlcuding dune stabilisation, agroforestry, tannin production and as ornamental trees. These trees escaped from their planted areas and have become widespread in the environment (invasive) (van Wilgen et al. 2011). The invasion process can take a long time from years to decades and is often dependent on the reason for introduction (dune stabilisation vs. ornamental purposes) and the propagule pressure (number of seeds introduced) (Blackburn et al. 2011).</p> <p>Land transformation, degradation and climate change facilitate the establishment and spread of invasive species, and enhance their competitive advantage over some native species. Forestry, as well as urbanisation in the Cape which required dune stabilisation, are important indirect drivers, as they led to the introduction and spread of Australian wattle species.</p>","<p>(1) The megadiverse fynbos shrubland (Mediterranean type vegetation), was maintained by a 5 to 15-year fire cycle, nutrient-poor soils, and biotic interactions.</p> <p>(2) Wattle species were transported out of Australian and planted all over the Cape for forestry, dune stabilisation and ornamental purposes and many survived in this new region. With time many species became naturalised meaning they established small, localized, self-sustaining populations. In time, these naturalised populations then spread over large areas, became dominant and thus invasive. Fulfilment of an empty niche, release from natural predators and superior competitive abilities enabled these wattles to become invasive. Millions of hectares are now covered by wattle species in the fynbos biome and these invasions have dramatically altered the landscape structure and many ecosystem processes.</p> <p>Several feedbacks maintain the invaded regime and have long-lasting legacy effects, making it difficult to reverse the shift. Massive production of long-lived seeds that accumulate in the soil allows for the dominance of these wattles over time. Wattles also have a high competitive ability allowing them to outcompete native fynbos species, in that they fill an empty niche (trees introduced into shrublands) and have been released from their natural enemies (enemy relsease hypothesis). Furthermore, wattles alter soil nutrient levels to suit their growth which reinforces their dominance. They also alter fire regimes which help to promote their germination and growth, while having negative effects on the growth and survival of native species. Wattles further alter biotic interactions, such as the presence of soil bacteria, which facilitates their growth and survival.</p> <p>Australian wattle invasion outcompetes native plants, resulting in losses of biodiversity and associated livelihood practices associated. Altered fire cycles, changes in soil nutrients and altered water flow as a result of the invasion inhibit native species growth and induce long-lasting legacy effects that thwart post-management recovery and reduce options for restoration (Le Maitre et al. 2011 Gaertner et al. 2014).</p>","<p>This regime shift has many negative as well as some positive impacts on ecosystem services. Negative effects on provisioning services include loss of water delivery from catchments, reduced agricultural potential, and the loss of various provisioning ecosystem services (non-timber forest products). Wattles grow in very high densities and suck up large amounts of surface and ground water that negatively affect dam levels (Le Maitre et al. 1996). Thick invasive stands of wattles are impenetrable and outcompete palatable grass and shrub species thus reducing grazing capacity. Wattle invasions also displace native plants species that are harvested such as flowers from <em>Protea </em>species and plants (<em>Restio</em>) used for thatching (Tupie et al. 2003).</p> <p>Key regulating services that are negatively impacted are fire regimes, nutrient cycles, hydrological and biotic interactions. Wattles increase fire intensity and frequency having negative effects on biodiversity, soil and humans though increasing the chances of natural hazards (Gaertner et al. 2014). Wattles change soil nutrients through increased litter loads and novel interactions with soil bacteria (Le Maitre et al. 2011). Wattles also alter micro climates that have negative effects on native species. High densities of wattles in narrow catchments can also increase flood and erosion risks, and reduce water purification services by increasing flow rates. Furthermore, they compete for pollinators with native plant species.</p> <p>These invasions also have negative implications for cultural services, including recreational, aesthetic and spiritual values. For example, wattles invasion reduces access to sacred pools which are culturally and spiritually important for the Xhosa people (Shackleton et al. 2007). Thy also invade areas important for ecotourism and hiking thus negatively affecting recreation and aesthetic values.</p> <p>Some benefits from shifts to invasive monocultures are the increased availability of fuelwood (energy), dune stability and aesthetic values. Many invasive wattle species are still planted on properties to provide shade and beautification. Fuelwood is harvested by rural poor communities, and some people even make a business out of selling wattle fuelwood in urban areas. Furthermore, in many areas, sand stabilisation due to wattle invasion has increased the availability of land for building, especially in the flat areas around Cape Town.</p> <p>The negative impacts on ecosystem services have substantial implications for local livelihoods and human well-being. These include losses of income/economic productivity due to reduced cropping and livestock production, reduced water supply, losses in ecotourism, and loss of non-timber forest products (Shackleton et al. 2007). This in turn has implications for food security. Wattle invasion also increase peoples exposure to natural hazards and disasters (fires, droughts, floods), which can impact housing and infrastructure. Dense stands are used as hideouts by criminals and therefore create safety issues for local communities. Wattle stands also reduce access to areas of cultural importance. On the other hand, some people benefit culturally through aesthetic value from garden trees and directly through the use and sale of fuelwood, and the ability to build houses on stabilised soils. Others make a profit through using wattle species for forestry. The tradeoff between benefits and costs often lead to conflicts of interest between different stakeholders.</p>","<p>Numerous actions can be taken to prevent the shift. This includes preventing both purposeful and accidental introduction of wattle species. This can be done through border checks, risk assessments and ensuring vectors of spread are managed (e.g. imported equipment is washed down or sterilised). Furthermore, there are several Australian wattle species that are currently in the naturalised phase (only present in small self-sustaining populations). They should be targeted for eradication before they become invasive and induce shifts and negative impacts on ecosystem services and human well-being. This is done through monitoring land areas to find naturalised populations, and where present using manual and chemical clearing methods to remove them. Follow up clearing will have to be conducted for a number of years afterwards until the seed bank is depleted.</p> <p>Numerous management interventions are currently available and being implemented to reverse and reduce the impacts of the shift (van Wilgen et al. 2011). This includes mechanical and chemical control by private land owners and the state run poverty relief Working for Water (WfW) program (van Wilgen et al. 2012). The WfW program is a sate rung initiative that aims to restore ecosystem services and landscapes after invasions and to employ rural communities. Mechanical and chemical control involves cutting down and pulling out wattle trees. Cut stumps need herbicide to prevent coppicing and seedlings can be killed with foliar spray. Biological control is also being utilized and is showing success. Biological control is the introduction of natural enemies (insects, diseases, fungi) of the invasive species from their native range. Many biological control agents for Australian acacia species have been released in South Africa, to target seed production and increase tree mortality. Some have taken well and species like A. cyclops are reducing in extent.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","(#1) Allsopp N. 2014. Fynbos: ecology, evolution and conservation of a megadiverse region.

The main driver of this shift was the increase in fuel amount and continuity due to rural depopulation (vegetation and fuel build-up after farm abandonment) suggesting that fires were fuel-limited previous to the shift. Climatic conditions are poorly related to wildfire activity during the pre-shift period and strongly related during the to post-shift period, suggesting that fires are currently less fuel limited and more drought-driven than before. Thus, the fire regime shift implies also a shift in the main driver for fire activity. This shift was dated in the 1970s in Spain but this may varies in other countries.</p>","Fire regime shift","Mediterranean shrubs (egFynbos)","Small-scale subsistence crop cultivation","Sub-continental/regional (e.g. southern Africa, Amazon basin)","Europe","Mediterranean Basin","Spain, Greece","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(#1) Pausas J.G. & Fernández-Muñoz S. 2012.

Shrub encroachment has been observed during the last three decades, but has been controlled by reindeer grazing. These changes have produced two regime states: shrubland without reindeer herding, and open land with reindeer herding. The first regime is mainly caused by temperature increase, which has produced warmer winters, summers and extended growing seasons. These temperature changes have altered the controlling feedbacks of the tundra, such as slow growth of shrubs, microbial activity, and decomposition litter rates.

Indirectly, the Nenets impact the open land regime; the number of reindeer herding Nenets loosely determines how many reindeer will be able to use the land (Kumpala et al. 2012).&nbsp; A main driver of change impacting Nenets-reindeer relations comes from gas exploitation on the Yamal Peninsula.&nbsp; An increase in gas exploitation infrastructure (ex. pipelines, etc.) has the potential to fragment the land (Forbes et al. 2009), and therefore disrupt the reindeer driven reinforcing feedback loop.</p> <p>Once the land enters a shrub-dominated regime without reindeer herding, a reinforcing feedback loop promotes the establishment of more shrubs (Myers-Smith 2007).

In the long run, a shift towards open land could diminish biodiversity as an ecosystem service for the Yamal-Nenets, possibly leading to a degraded landscape and loss of productive reindeer herding land (Br&aring;then et al. 2007). The reindeers graze on dwarf shrubs, like willows. When shrubs are replaced by grass, Nenets lose provisional ecosystem services, such as food sources for the reindeers, and more importantly stocks of firewood (Walker et al. 2009, Degteva &amp; Nellemann 2013).&nbsp;Gains from the shift for the Nenets are the graminoid-dominated pastures, which lead to an increase in provisioning ecosystem services. In Yamal the loss of shrubs has been compensated for by the net increases in productivity among highly nutritious and digestible forage species (Forbes et al. 2009). This has given way for more reindeers, which means more resources to be able to access provisional ecosystem services: food, clothing and antlers to trade with the gas company employees (Forbes et al. 2009, Kumpala et al. 2012, Forbes et al. 2013, Degteva &amp; Nellemann 2013). As for regulating services, increased abundance of reindeers leads to a reinforcing feedback, which keeps the grass state by trampling, grazing, and addition of nutrients (Forbes et al. 2009).&nbsp;</span></p> <p class='normal' style='margin-bottom: 6pt; line-height: 114%;'><span style='line-height: 114%;'>Grassland has been suggested to dampen global warming, due to increased albedo in winter (Zimov et al. 1995).

With this shift - especially if combined with the expected severe land use change due to Yamal gas exploitation (Kumpala et al. 2012) - provisional services for the Nenets would decrease due to the lower abundance of reindeers. This would in turn diminish a wide array of cultural and spiritual ecosystem services, such as lost sense of place, practices of the everyday life on the tundra, and holy places (Forbes et al. 2009, Kumpala et al. 2012).</span></p> <p class='normal' style='margin-bottom: 6pt; line-height: 114%;'><span style='line-height: 114%;'>Increased shrubland would, on the other hand, be beneficial for biodiversity, opening up for larger populations of birds (Henden et al. 2013), herbivores other than reindeers, and predators such as wolves and wolverines (Golovatin et al. 2012). </span><span style='line-height: 114%;'>With this succession, in combination of the expected influx of thousands of migrant oil and gas workers, there could be increased possibilities for hunting and recreation.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>The shrub dominated regime is seen as an undesirable regime since the vegetation is unfavorable for the Nenets nomads&rsquo; traditional reindeer herding lifestyle.

In the Northwest Atlantic, cod fisheries collapsed within one fishing season in the early 1990s and overfishing was the main driver. &nbsp;At that period in time, cod stocks in the Northwest Atlantic were overestimated both scientifically and from fishing industry. Furthermore fishing quotas were inadequate and disregarded because of a &ldquo;tragedy of the commons&rdquo; problem (Milich 1999) and because of foreign fishing fleets not respecting Canadian and NAFO regulations (Lilly et al. 2013). </span></p> <p dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify;'><span style='font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>A climatic seesaw pattern, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), played its part in the downfall of Canadian cod fisheries alongside overfishing. If NAO values become positive, westerly winds in the North Atlantic increase in strength leading to milder conditions in the Northeast Atlantic and to cooler conditions in the northwestern part of the ocean (Cohen &amp; Barlow 2005). These conditions act as a negative driver impacting cod stocks on a biogeographical as well as a physiological level. Migrations into warmer waters and higher mortalities among cod populations are the cause of strong positive NAO values (Rose et al. 2000).</span></p> <p><strong style='font-weight: normal;'><strong style='font-weight: normal;'>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p> <p dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p>","<p class='p1'><span class='s1'><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial;'>In the late 1980s and 90s overfishing became a main problem in the Canadian cod fishery. A lack of regulating fishing policies lead to overexploitation of stocks through Canadian and international fishing fleets (Lilly et al. 2013). In combination with new technological advances in the fisheries sector and a misunderstanding of the prevailing size of cod stocks the viable cod fishery regime&nbsp;was driven towards turning into a collapsed cod fishery state (Myers et al. 1997). Climatic regional cooling in the Northwest Atlantic due to a positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) contributed its share. Low water temperatures caused cod populations to migrate further south into warmer waters and caused decreases in metabolic rate, personal fitness and larval recruitment and increased cod mortality (Myers et al. 1997; Rose et al. 2000; Fromentin&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Planque 1996). As a result of overfishing and climatic change, cod fisheries collapsed in the fishing season 1991/92 in Canada.</span></span></p> <p><strong style='font-weight: normal;'><strong style='font-weight: normal;'>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p> <p dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;'>&nbsp;</p>","<p dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;'>&nbsp;</p> <p dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify;'><span style='font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>Cod provided provisioning services in the form of food and cultural services in the form of employment in the fishing industry as well as cultural identity for communities that grew up around the fisheries for over 500 years. </span><span style='font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>As the cod industry collapsed, a strong global market for shellfish encouraged the replacement of cod with northern shrimp and snow crab.

In 1973-1975 the Northwest Atlantic (NWA) region around Newfoundland removed any non Canadian shipping fleets to reduce the number of vessels fishing cod. In 1977 a 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) was implemented. Ongoing fast implementation of quotas and regulations occurred in response to perceived declines of cod stock in the collapse in the northeast Atlantic. However there was no such response in the NWA until a complete collapse in the early 1990s (Lilly et al</span><span style='font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>. </span><span style='font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>2013).</span></p> <p dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify;'>&nbsp;</p> <p dir='ltr' style='line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify;'><span style='font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>Actions to restore the cod regime include the ban of commercial fisheries in the Northwest Atlantic after the collapse in the 1990s. The input control limited the number of licences for recreational fishing and the output controls limited the total allowable catch and decreased the quotas. These quotas were continuously assessed via the harvest control rule, where predictions and current stock levels influenced the quota for the following year. In 1997 the provincial act of professionalisation of the harvesting sector was implemented to limit access and to provide other types of training to fish harvesters. Several task forces focused on the restructuring and adjustment programs were established in response to the collapse of cod fisheries, such as the federal -provincial Cod Recovery Action Teams. The mandate of these &nbsp;teams is to develop stock rebuilding and long term management strategies. This is a joint initiative between the federal (government) and provincial (fishing communities) where there is an extensive consultation of a variety of stakeholder with regular exchange of information. However restructuring initiatives and adjustment programs were terminated in 2005 due to several reasons, including high cost and failure to meet the social needs of stakeholders. (Khan &amp; Chuenpagdee, 2013; DFO, 2010). The Northwest Atlantic Fishery Organisation (NAFO) now regulates the seas outside of the Canadian EEZ after the Portuguese-crewed vessel fishing 45km outside of the EEZ harvested juvenile cod for the Portuguese market (Milich 1999). The NAFO regulate quotas for all of the northwest, currently the total allowable catch for 2013 is 14,000 metric tons (NAFO.int. 2013).

For example before the collapse the management regime was top down and used a single species approach, whereas post collapse the management was integrated and moved towards an ecosystem approach alongside stakeholder involvement. Biologically and ecologically sensitive habitats were identified and protected post collapse - &nbsp;previously there was no such regulation. &nbsp;Pre collapse, there were no regulations regarding gear type - restrictions in gear type and usage were implemented post collapse. </span><span style='font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>Dock-side monitoring programs in addition to log books and vessel monitoring prevent incidences of misreportings, high grading, illegal and unreported catches which were prevalent pre collapse (Khan &amp; Chuenpagdee 2013).</span></p>","(#1) Arnason, R., Sandal, L.

We consider climate change, trade, and imports as system drivers.</p> <p><strong><em>Traditional Livelihood</em></strong></p> <p>In the first regime there is a naturally variable climate, and the Inuit are highly adaptive to it via their mobility (following the game). They hunt for subsistence, which&nbsp;is an important part of their culture and main livelihood. The environment shapes their lives, and they are highly dependent on sea ice for hunting a broad range of species (e.g. seal, whale, caribou) and for transportation (e.g. dog sledge or snowmobile). The Inuit can live without seasonal constraints on hunting, they cooperate (e.g. leaving food for each other in caches), and only hunt what they need for survival.</p> <p><strong><em>Wage Employment</em></strong></p> <p>In the second regime the sea ice is changing faster than in the past, due to anthropogenic climate change, and the environment no longer resembles what the traditional language is able to describe (e.g. name of places no longer describe the current landforms). The sea ice is thinner, breaking up earlier in spring, and freezes later in autumn. This affects the polynyas (open patches of water surrounded by ice), restricting mobility and therefore hunting activities (Hastrup 2008, Laidler et al. 2008). Weather conditions are less favorable (e.g. more rain, snow and fog) with faster changes, with the result of Inuit struggling to predict the weather and seasonal conditions. &nbsp;Generally, the social landscape is more centralized, with permanent settlements, a higher degree of trade, and global influences and opportunities. Future generations face Arctic conditions unable to support traditional Inuit livelihoods, and they may be forced to rely solely on wage employment. The only other option may be to emigrate.</p>","<p><strong>Shift from Traditional Livelihood to Wage Employment</strong></p> <p>Anthropogenic climate change is considered the main driver for this regime shift. &nbsp;The global increase in&nbsp;greenhouse gas emissions causes higher Arctic temperatures, resulting in a decrease in sea ice (IPCC 2014). In recent decades, the consequences of climate change have increased exponentially. Despite being highly adaptive and habituated to a changing environment, the traditional livelihoods, human wellbeing, and connection to the land in Inuit communities are under stress (Hastrup 2009, 2013, Willox et al. 2013).</p> <p>Thin and unstable ice, in combination with unpredictable weather patterns, makes it hard for Inuit to travel and hunt safely (Nuttall 2005, Hastrup 2009). In order to follow the game and continue their traditional way of living, the Inuit rely on&nbsp;their traditional knowledge and adaptive skills (Ford 2008). This knowledge and skillset is required for safe travel, hunting, and managing prey species. Changing ice dynamics creates a mismatch between knowledge and reality. The language used to describe places evolves slower than the rate landforms are changing from year to year. Place names often aren&rsquo;t up to date, or their meanings are no longer applicable. The seasonal timing of hunting can be delayed, due to shifting and unrecognisable weather patterns (Hastrup 2009, 2013). Fewer young people hunt today (trade and import substituting for hunting activities in some Inuit communities), and permanent settlement patterns are replacing the semi-nomadic lifestyle characterized by traditional Inuit livelihoods and knowledge. The transmission of traditional knowledge from one generation to the next is constrained by changing community dynamics, related to intergenerational segregation, an increasingly dominant monetized economy, and eroded social network structures (Ford 2008, Kral 2003).</p> <p><strong>Shift from Wage Employment to Traditional Livelihood</strong></p> <p>Drivers for sustaining the regime of traditional Inuit livelihoods are those resulting in the predictable formation of stable ice - if we assume that Inuit communities are reliant upon traditional foods and hunting practices in the long-run. We do not consider a shift from regime 2 to 1 possible in reality, since there is no strong evidence that the sea-ice cover will increase during this century (IPCC 2014).</p>","<p><strong>Shift from Traditional Livelihood to Wage Employment</strong></p> <p>Traditional livelihoods rely on predictable ice cover, and natural seasonal variations stable enough for hunting, transportation of goods, and travel. There is a high abundance of natural resources available for pursuing traditional Inuit livelihoods. The relevance of indigenous knowledge is high, and knowledge adapts to the prevailing Arctic conditions. Mobility provides the basis for this adaptive lifestyle. Another prominent condition is a lack of alternatives to traditional ways of subsistence, and there is little to no contact with sub-arctic populations.</p> <p>Key drivers that contribute to the traditional livelihood shifting to wage employement include anthropogenic climate change that drives the reduction of ice cover and the increase in unpredictable weather conditions, forcing the Inuit to find alternative livelihoods not dependent upon the ice and mobility.&nbsp;Imported food and technology may help to increase food security in the short-term, but drives the substitution of traditional resources and practices, creating a need for monetary income and pushing communities toward wage-employment. The change in the social dynamics and shifts in generational attitudes drive the erosion and abandonment of traditional networks and knowledge, which has a theoretical threshold for the minimum amount necessary to pursue a traditional livelihood.</p> <p>In the wage employment regime, the conditions are characterized by receding ice cover and unpredictable weather patterns. These factors fundamentally affect prey species and hunting, mobility, and viability of traditional livelihoods. Economic and geopolitical interest in the Arctic, such as alternative trade routes and resource extraction, may increase the diversity of occupations and external resources available to some communities in the Arctic region. The availability of external resources purchased from stores gives some Inuit communities extra flexibility and food security while trying to adapt to changing Arctic conditions.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>Lost provisional ecosystem services include many of the prey species the Inuit hunt and fish (Wesche et al. 2010) for fuel (bubbler) and harvested wild products (seal fur used for traditional clothing, skin boats) (ICC 2008). This is due to reduced mobility, changes in wildlife migration patterns, and habitat fragmentation.&nbsp;If we consider fresh water as a provisional ecosystem service, there are lower levels of stored drinking water (Wesche et al. 2010, Dicks 2011). One consequence of increased ice-melting is increased hydroelectric power generating potential, depending on the context. &nbsp;The potential increases in the short-term, but will decrease in the long-term because water volume will decrease as glaciers disappear (Dicks 2011).&nbsp;Inuit consider traditional foods to be better tasting, culturally important, more nutritious and healthier than store-bought food (Ford 2010). Dependence on available store-bought food is increasing community health problems (e.g. obesity) (Wesche et al. 2010). Since fewer young people are hunting, traditional knowledge and skills are being lost. As a consequence of underemployment and expanding permanent settlements, there incidence of social conflicts, alcohol addiction, depression and suicide are also increasing (Ford et al. 2010, ICC 2009).&nbsp;In the&nbsp;wage employment regime, Arctic communities benefit from permanent facilities like hospitals (contributing to increased life expectancy, and reduced infant mortality) and schools (preparing children for modern challenges while preserving their culture) (UNESCO 2009). However, housing conditions are poor in these more permanent settlements (ICC 2009).</p> <p>There will be a loss of cultural ecosystem services as communities are forced to move towards a wage employment to subsist, i.e. as knowledge related to hunting and traditional medicines is lost (Dicks 2011). Increased access to the Arctic increases opportunities for tourism which would likely impact the lifestyles and cultural ecosystem services provided by local communities (Dicks 2011). These ecosystem services&nbsp;might increase or decrease depending on whether local communities continue to adapt and preserve their culture and local knowledge, or make use of them to generate revenues from tourism-focused activities. Decreased access and availability of traditional food, and increased dependence on wage-employment and store-bought foods, cause a loss of traditional practices. This has negative impacts on food security, food sharing practices (Ford et al 2010), cultural identity, and local communities&rsquo; physical and mental health (Willox et al 2013).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>The traditional Inuit culture and livelihoods are characterized by their ability to adapt to prevailing conditions. This adaptive capacity allowed the Inuit&rsquo;s Paleolithic ancestors to follow the ice into the Arctic region, and learn how to subsist on the resources of the polar ecosystem (S&oslash;rensen 2010). Given sufficient time, this highly adaptive culture might be equally adept at surviving in the warmer Arctic of the Anthropocene; but the present <em>pace</em> of anthropogenic climate change is straining the capacity of the traditional Inuit ways of life to remain viable, for both current and future generations.&nbsp;Herein lies the potential for management and policy strategies in preventing a regime shift: from traditional livelihoods centered on subsistence hunting, of culturally and ecologically significant species; to one of wage based employment, and reliance on the global economy and institutions. Ford et al. (2010) suggest a number of targets for policy management, aimed at increasing the adaptive capacity of Inuit culture [in Canada], including:<em>&ldquo;... supporting the teaching and transmission of traditional skills, enhancing and reviewing emergency management capability, ensuring the flexibility of resource management regimes, economic support to facilitate adaptation for groups with limit household income, increased research effort to identify short and long term risk factors and adaptive response options, and promotion of awareness of climate change impacts and adaptation among the policy making community.'</em></p> <p>Restoring the regime where traditional livelihoods dominate requires the&nbsp;survival of the living repository of the knowledge, methods and practices upon which they are founded. Such information is preserved in the oral traditions and experiential learning techniques of the Inuit. Once ceased being used, theywill be irretrievably lost. Possible management efforts like the Igloolik Oral History Project (IOHP) (Ford 2008), consisting of over 500 interviews, may preserve some of the cultural heritage necessary to reconstitute traditional livelihoods, but this remains uncertain.</p>","(#1) Aporta, C.

Apart from natural oscillations, populations are stable, as the life cycle is not critically influenced by human activities, rather, they are mainly limited by natural mortality causes such as predation, disease, or density-dependent effects (Quinn 2011). In this scenario, the ecological functions in the different ecosystems they are part of are maintained (e.g. Holtgrieve &amp; Schindler 2011; Quinn 2011).&nbsp;The local fishery is profitable for companies, and in turn grants good livelihoods to local communities. At the same time, their food security needs are met through sustenance. Fishing practice, and the cultural, educational and recreational values are kept through the practice of fishing (Griffiths 2014, pers. comm.). Management successfully implements long-term sustainability of the fishery, hatchery recruitment is limited as natural recruitment is preferred (Schindler et al. 2008; Schindler et al. 2010).</p> <p style='line-height: 115%;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='line-height: 115%;'><strong>Salmon depletion</strong></p> <p style='line-height: 115%;'>In this potential regime, the adult individuals in the ocean offshore Alaska are reduced to consistently low numbers, and variability in population numbers through time is high&nbsp;(Schindler et al. 2010). Anthropogenic drivers that are external to the salmon life cycle are the ones that mainly drive the system (Schindler et al. 2008; Rogers et al. 2013). High rates of fishing strongly decrease adult salmon stocks, especially in areas where management fails to implement measures of sustainability (e.g. fishing quotas, hatcheries regulation).&nbsp;Hatcheries have a prominent role in recruitment, harming populations heterogeneity and resilience, making them increasingly vulnerable (Schindler et al. 2010).&nbsp;Global warming has a strong impact on primary productivity and smolt migration behavior, leading to reduced survival.&nbsp;The local fisheries are in a bad economic situation. The general income for local communities from the fishing industry dramatically decreases and there is a general decrease in people&rsquo;s wellbeing on aspects related to the practice of fishing.</p>","<p style='line-height: 115%;'>The primary drivers of this potential regime shift would be changes in oceanic conditions (Kilduff et al. 2014) and overfishing (Schindler et al. 2010). The second climatic regime shift of the North Pacific in 1989 caused widespread fluctuations in fish population numbers, although it was regarded as a minor shift compared to the first one in 1976-77 (Ruggerone et al. 2007). However, the decline in population numbers may have been amplified by unsustainable fishing (Litzow et al. 2014) causing alternations in population structures and functions (Schildler et al. 2008).</p> <p style='line-height: 115%;'>With this in mind when regarding the future it can be suggested that the ongoing global warming potentially will effect both the oceanic and fresh-water conditions of the salmon habitats (Post et al. 2009). As the timing of smolt migration is crucial for population recruitment (Kilduff et al. 2014), increased unpredictability in oceanic water conditions due to a warming climate may cause declining survival rates of smolt at the ocean entry stage (Kilduff et al. 2014) and therefore put stress on the population.&nbsp;In addition to this, the populations&rsquo; resilience to natural variability may be reduced by fishing (Schindler et al. 2010), meaning that the effects of changes in water conditions might put more stress on the population than it would have had under pristine conditions. However, overfishing on its own could also cause population collapse due to e.g. tropic cascades, causing shifts in top-down or bottom-up structures of the ecosystem, or Allee effect, meaning that low numbers of reproductively mature adults leads to <span style='color: black; background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;'>reduced rates</span> in <span style='color: black; background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;'>population growth</span>.&nbsp;Other important causes for a regime shift could be reduced genetic and behavioural diversity (Schindler et al. 2010) due to the extensive use of hatcheries. As only a part of the returning adults are selected to hatcheries, the groups of smolt released from this artificial spawning will have a lower genetic diversity than a group resulting from natural spawning (Wild Salmon Centre 2014).</p>","<p style='line-height: 115%;'>Salmon population dynamics in the Alaskan system maintain equilibrated number of individuals, if the system is not affected by external anthropogenic disturbances, as paleo-records show (Rogers et al. 2013).&nbsp;Alaskan local communities have needs in terms of food security, income, recreation, education, and other. To cover for these needs they rely on fishing as their main activity (Schindler et al. 2010), and salmon not only has a value in food and nutrition, but also is one of the major drivers of the local economy, ensuring several aspects of wellbeing (Schindler et al. 2010). These needs therefore cause the necessity for fishing economically valuable salmon at their life stage of adulthood.&nbsp;At the same time, being identified as a common pool resource, there is a necessity to apply management on the resource, to avoid potential issues of non-excludability and conflict among users. Management therefore regulates the fishery using as proxy the amount of salmon returning upstream to spawn (Schindler et al. 2010). To sustain high enough levels of catch hatching activity is also implemented by management (Schindler et al. 2008). These variables related to the social drivers of the system are mutually affected through feedback systems.</p> <p style='line-height: 115%;'>Global warming, enhanced by human activity, affects population dynamics mainly in two ways. On the one hand migration from rivers to oceans in the smolt stage is affected due to increased variability of environmental signals for migration (Post et al. 2009) whereas Alaskan salmon smolts migrating too early show less survival at the critical ocean entry stage than those that migrate later (Kilduff et al. 2014). On the other hand, increased climate variability affecting oceanic currents patterns varies the amount of nutrients in these areas and in turn ecosystem productivity. Less productive waters determine lower survival of smolts as they enter the ocean (Kilduff et al. 2014).</p> <p style='line-height: 115%;'>The drivers act simultaneously on the populations, leading them in an escalating loop of lower survival of juveniles, low abundance of adults and reduced population heterogeneity (Krosek &amp; Drake 2014). This high instability of population dynamics would make it difficult to reverse the trend into the desirable state of abundance (Griffiths 2014, pers. comm.). Loss of key ecosystem services and failure of societal objectives would be an inevitable consequence (Schindler et al. 2010).</p>","<p style='line-height: 115%;'><span style='background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;'>A regime with a high abundance of salmon benefits the societies in terms of </span><em>cultural</em>, <em>provisioning</em> and <em>regulating ecosystem services</em>. It also profits them concerning employment, pest regulation, food-web regulating mechanisms, biodiversity and regulation of hypoxia (Schindler et al. 2010; MA 2006).</p> <p style='line-height: 115%;'>As fish stocks become depleted due to overfishing, and before the hatcheries manage to level out the discrepancy, the relational dynamic of fishermen and governing institutions might possibly change.&nbsp;If the governing institutions that manage the fish stocks stop the fishing temporarily, or lower the fishing quotas, the relationship between the fishermen and institutions risk to become worse due to a mismatch between the fishermen&acute;s needs, and the governments management (their wants). A conflict is consequently more likely to arise (Chun &amp; Choi, n.d). In other words, their relational wellbeing, defined as peoples&acute; &ldquo;satisfaction with relationships&rdquo;, is likely to be negatively affected (De Leersnyder et al. 2014: 242). In sum, the fishing communities, and less resilient ecosystems, might accordingly be the long run loser of the SES.&nbsp;<span style='background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;'>Loss of species&acute; heterogeneity, intensified climate change and increased </span>fishing pressure makes the system more sensitive to perturbation.&nbsp;A less resilient system might, ultimately, lead to a decrease in&nbsp;salmon stocks and consequently, have negative impacts on food security, economic activity, cultural ecosystem services and cultural identity (Hilborn et al. 2003; Kelty &amp; Kelty 2011). i.e., if losing the provisioning ecosystem service, an aspect of human<em>&nbsp;wellbeing</em>&nbsp;that is concerned with the food- and economic security in this case, the communities will not only risk to lose the regulating-, but also the cultural values. The latter one is part of <em>subjective wellbeing&nbsp;</em>(Villamagna&amp;Giesecke 2014).&nbsp;However, subjective wellbeing&nbsp;is also concerned with peoples&acute; own satisfaction of their situation (Villamagna &amp; Giesecke 2014). If they lose the salmon, there is a high risk that they consider themselves worse off than before. Thus the loss of the providing ecosystem service would not only affect the material-, but also the subjective well-being. <em>Relational wellbeing</em>&nbsp;is yet another aspect of human wellbeing&nbsp;that will be affected.</p> <p style='line-height: 115%;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='line-height: 115%;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='line-height: 115%;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='line-height: 115%;'>&nbsp;</p> <p style='line-height: 115%;'>&nbsp;</p>","<p style='margin-bottom: 6pt; line-height: 115%;'>Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) acts to maintain an abundant salmon population (ADFG, 2014). To keep salmon population stable management in Alaska mainly acts in two ways.&nbsp;One management action is through fishery regulations and quotas. Fishing quotas are primarily set by the ADFG who regulates the amount of fish to catch each year (ADFG 2014). Quotas are partly set dependent on salmon abundance in the ocean. One way to assess salmon abundance is by counting returning spawners (Schindler et al. 2010).&nbsp;Another management action is connected to Alaska&rsquo;s salmon hatcheries. Alaskan hatcheries were introduced some decades ago as one way to maintain abundant salmon populations. The hatcheries are mostly used as way to complement natural recruitment and to enhance Alaska&rsquo;s commercial fisheries and the economical opportunities that follow (ADFG 2014). When natural recruitment fails to maintain high abundance of salmon, increased management through hatchery recruitment can maintain abundant salmon populations (Griffiths, 2014, pers. comm.).</p> <p style='margin-bottom: 6pt; line-height: 115%;'><strong><br /></strong>There are different actions to take in order to return to abundant salmon populations if collapse of salmon populations in Alaska would occur.&nbsp;Firstly, a ban on salmon fishing would have to be implemented in order to save what is left (Schindler et al. 2010). ADFG controls fishery management in the region and actions taken would emerge from this department. Co-management, to include local stakeholders, could be central in order to build trust, solve potential conflicts that could occur and to join forces in solving the problem of how to adapt to the low abundance of salmon (Berkes 2009).&nbsp;Secondly, if hatcheries have been managed in ways that caused a decrease in heterogeneity between and within salmon populations, this could cause a potential collapse of salmon. In this case management would have to be modified. Hatchery management would have to have focus on a higher degree of diversity when selecting individuals to breed. This would increase heterogeneity between and within future salmon populations. Increased heterogeneity builds more resilient populations (Schindler et al. 2008; Schindler et al. 2010).&nbsp;Thirdly, changes in ocean conditions due to global warming could lead to a decreased smolt survival at the ocean entry stage (Kilduff et al. 2014) that could lead to a potential salmon collapse. In order to reach a stop to global warming international management must be implemented (IPCC 2014).</p>","(#1) ADFG (2014). Alaska department of game and fishery. State of Alaska, USA.

"392","2014-01-25 00:00:00","Tokaj wine region socialization","Béla Kuslits","Reinette (Oonsie) Biggs, Juan Carlos Rocha","<p>Tokaj-Hegyalja, a wine region in north-eastern Hungary has undergone a regime shift from small-scale and high-quality wine producing strategy to a low-quality industrialized strategy. For centuries before the regime shift, mostly local families and wealthy individuals owned and operated the vineyards. The high-quality regime was maintained by the high number of wineries, the high level of local ecological knowledge and the access to the European markets where the wines were sold for good prices. After the Second World War Hungary remained under the Soviet influence, and a socialist, authoritarian regime started to govern the country. The vineyards and wineries in the Tokaj region were socialized and became parts of a large, state-operated winemaking company following a highly quantity-oriented strategy in wine-production and selling the wines in the socialist (Comcon) countries. First, the industrialized regime was forced by an external power, but later, the regime became stable as the number of wineries decreased, the local knowledge wasn't used any more and the vineyards were transformed to produce large quantities. Many high-quality but low productivity vineyards have been abandoned and became high biodiversity areas (mostly forests). Even after the political changes in 1989 the stable state remained intact as the most important factors sustaining the high-quality regime were lacking. This regime is maintained by a high demand for cheap wine, state subsidies and the missing contacts to the quality sensitive markets. Today, as the former Soviet market collapsed, the region is facing a poverty trap. As Hungary joined the European Union in 2004, the abandoned vineyards became Natura 2000 conservation areas, thus it is difficult to use them for agriculture. However, after the political changes in 1989 the state owned vineyards were privatized and there are more and more private wineries producing high-quality wines. Some of them have gained access to quality sensitive markets and started to operate in a new quality-oriented regime. It's however uncertain whether the region will flip back in the near future to a quality-oriented scheme or if it will remain a marginal strategy.</p>","Governance change","Agro-ecosystems","Small-scale subsistence crop cultivation, Large-scale commercial crop cultivation, Conservation","Local/landscape (e.g. lake, catchment, community)","Europe","North-eastern Hungary, Tokaj-Hegyalja World Heritage Region","Hungary","Adoption of new technology","Small-scale subsistence crop cultivation, Large-scale commercial crop cultivation, Conservation","Agro-ecosystems","","Biodiversity","Food crops","","Recreation, Aesthetic values, Knowledge and educational values","Food and nutrition, Livelihoods and economic activity, Cultural, aesthetic and recreational values, Social conflict, Cultural identity","","Local/landscape","Years","Hysteretic","Contemporary observations","Speculative – Regime shift has been proposed, but little evidence as yet","Speculative – Mechanisms have been proposed, but little evidence as yet","<p><strong>Small-scale wineries, High Quality</strong></p> <p>There are around 5-6000 acres of small-scale vineyard in the region. There is no forest on the mountains, the soil is thin and rocky, people are growing grapes on steep hillsides - in many cases by hand. The local families and wineries are cultivating, harvesting and producing wine independently. The knowledge and tradition about wine making is well distributed among the local people, there is enough capacity for experimentation, adaptation and learning.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Large-scale winery, Large Quantity</strong></p> <p>In this regime, the vineyards are transformed to produce large quantities. They are cultivated with tractors, the whole procedure is centralized and coordinated by the state-owned company in a very cost-effective way. The wine is exported to the Comecon countries. The yearly harvest per plant is sometimes up to ten times bigger than before, but the wine quality is much lower.</p>","<p>The regime shift happened after the Second World War, as Hungary became part of the Eastern bloc. The national economy was transformed to planned economy and became dependent on the Soviet Union in many ways. The Soviet Union had an enormous political influence in the country, there was no way to argue or resist. In Tokaj-Hegyalja first all the vineyards were socialized in 1948, than starting in 1953 all of them where transformed to produce larger quantities. The region started producing wine only for the Comcon market, there were no real market processes present during the dictatorship.</p>","<p>Before 1948, most wineries in the region were small-scale. There were two important feedbacks maintaining this state. The first is the high level of knowledge maintained by the high number of wineries and the constant experience in making good quality wines. The knowledge level of the local community is a slow variable in this system. The second important feedback loop is the access to the quality sensitive markets, which makes it possible to sell the wines for a high price, which enables investment in technology and workforce. These factors have a key importance in long-term success.</p> <p>After the Second World War, Hungary became part of the Eastern bloc. As the Communist party (supported by the Soviet Union) took over the political power, planned economy was introduced and Hungary became isolated from the Western European countries. People in Tokaj-Hegyalja were forced to join the co-operative.</p> <p>As the number of wineries decreased (to practically one single company), and the connections to the European market were cut, new feedbacks started to dominate the system. In this setting, the most important factor generating revenue is the quantity of the wine produced. The cheap wine was sold to the Soviet market and the unprofitable local economy was subsidized by the state. The change was first forced by political power, but lately it became persistent as in the coming decades the local society lost most of its traditional knowledge and adopted the socialist wine making strategy. This loss of knowledge and the loss of former markets are the two most important factors behind maintaining the intensive cultivation method even after the political 'regime change' in 1989. From this perspective, the political change in 1989 wasn't a regime shift at all. Though the steep and rocky hillsides are the best places to produce high-quality wines, the cultivation on these vineyards is expensive and the amount of grapes harvested is low, thus many of the best vineyards were abandoned after the regime shift. These places became natural habitats, often high biodiversity forests in the coming decades. Today these places are Natura 2000 conservation areas, which makes it difficult to reintroduce wine production. After 1989 the Soviet market was also lost. The state-owned vineyards were privatized, but the successor of the big socialist company remained dominant player in the region. Today, this company is buying up the grapes produced on the privatized vineyards, and the produced wine is sold for a cheap price. There was a small change in the economic structure, but basically the system remained intact: buying up the grapes, the state is still subsidizing the intensive wine producing strategy. Approximately 70% of the region is following this strategy today. The other third tried to produce higher quality wines, but many of them fail to reach the quality sensitive markets, therefore they aren't profitable. As the world winemarket is very competitive, it is a major challenge for the region to make a living by producing wine, thus Tokaj-Hegyalja is today in a poverty-trap, similarly to many regions in post-soviet countries.</p>","<p>Wine production is a fragile process where a major part of the work is 'done' by the soil and the grapes. As the vineyards were transformed, the ecosystem services were also transformed: before the regime shift, the grapes consisted of a wide variety of minerals, sugars and aromas to make high-quality wine. This was not possible to maintain when producing high quantities: under this conditions the plants are not capable of concentrate the minerals and nutrients in the grapes. The new ecosystem service was a production of large masses of grapes. In the past decades, the abandoned vineyards transformed to natural habitats having rich biodiversity and thus these became part of the Natura 2000 network (EEA 2013), which is also stabilizing the state after the regime shift.</p> <p>Due to the regime shift, cultural ecosystem services were also lost. The aesthetic, recreational and cultural values associated with the high-quality wine decreased dramatically. The knowledge maintained by the human-nature interactions was also lost. The long-term effect of the regime-shift on human wellbeing is a 'poverty trap'. Local people have some revenue from the quantity-oriented production, which is high enough to stabilize the system-state, but not enough for development, neither in the viniculture nor in their living standards. The regime-shift gained only political benefits.</p>","<p>Three major interventions are needed to restore the desirable regime in the wine-region. First is to educate local people about more competitive, high-quality winemaking methodologies and to invest in those technologies, which are required to produce better wine. The success of an education programme is highly dependent on the personal relations and trust among locals. The second is the restoration of the abandoned but formerly high-quality vineyards in the area and raise the quality standards on the winemaking process. The third intervention would be a better marketing for the region to reconnect it to the markets, but it is only possible if the communication and trust among local groups is increased to ensure better collaboration.</p>","(#1) EEA.

"391","2013-10-17 00:00:00","Zululand Wetlands","Linda Luvuno","Donovan Kotze, Damian Walters, Reinette (Oonsie) Biggs","<p>The shift from herbaceous (grass and sedge dominated) wetlands to swamp forest occurs when wetlands predominately covered in herbaceous vegetation become invaded by woody plant species and irreversibly change to a forest state. This shift occurs when wetlands experience disturbances that affect their hydrology and their natural disturbance regimes, notably their fire regime. In this case study in Zululand, large scale afforestation in the landscape surrounding the wetlands has changed the catchment from a system that uses a low amount of water to a system that uses large amounts of water (through different transpiration rates). This drying has led to shorter periods of soil saturation, which has altered the hydrology of the wetlands. Together with fire suppression, this has caused a shift in regime from herbaceous wetlands to wetlands dominated by indigenous swamp forest species. This regime shift has impacted biodiversity as the wetlands support a rich biodiversity of herbaceous species including the only known wild population of the critically endangered Kniphofia leucocephala. These wetlands are within one of the key water source areas of South Africa, thus this change has affected water supply. Local communities use these wetlands for grazing cattle, and this shift has reduced the area available for grazing. Removing trees from the wetlands is often difficult, therefore managerial recommendations focus on the avoidance through the establishment of a frequent fire regime (biennial) to prevent the recruitment of young trees. &nbsp;</p>","Herbaceous wetland to Swamp Forest","Grasslands","Extensive livestock production (natural rangelands), Timber production, Conservation","Local/landscape (e.g. lake, catchment, community)","Africa","KwaZulu-Natal","South Africa","Vegetation conversion and habitat fragmentation, Environmental shocks (eg floods), Global climate change","Extensive livestock production (rangelands), Timber production, Conservation","Grasslands","Primary production, Water cycling","Biodiversity","Freshwater, Livestock","Water regulation","Knowledge and educational values","Livelihoods and economic activity","","Local/landscape","Years, Decades","Hysteretic","Contemporary observations","Contested – Reasonable evidence both for and against the existence of RS","Well established – Wide agreement on the underlying mechanism","<p><strong>Herbaceous Wetland</strong></p> <p>This regime consists of hygrophilous grasslands and wetlands. These hygrophilous systems vary depending on soil saturation and depending on the level of wetness (temporarily, seasonally or permanently wet); different vegetation types will therefore be found in different wetlands. In areas with low levels of wetness, hygrophilous grasslands (occurring in temporary wet areas) will be found, while areas with increased levels of wetness have typical herbaceous wetland species such as Cyperus species and Nymphaea species, which occur in seasonally to permanently wet areas. Depending on the level of soil saturation, water may be visible depending on the season. Historically, some of these wetlands had so much water that they sustained fish.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Swamp Forest/ Macaranga capensis and Staenoclina tenuifolia woodland</strong></p> <p>This regime consists mainly of indigenous swamp forest species, notably <em>Ficus trichopoda, Bridelia micrantha, Syzygium cordatum, Staenoclina tenuifolia</em> and <em>Macaranga capensis</em>. Most areas become dominated by mainly <em>Macaranga capensis</em> and the fern S<em>taenoclina tenuifolia</em>, which establishes a dense under-storey, to the exclusion of any other herbaceous plants.</p>","<p>The main drivers of this change are plantation forestry in the surrounding landscape and fire suppression. Plantation forestry leads to large scale drying of the landscape (which affects hydrology of the wetlands), and in some cases the wetlands themselves have been converted into plantation forest. With less water available for the wetlands due to the high water interception and transpiration rates by plantation forests (Le Maitre et al. 1999), levels of soil saturation have decreased. At the same time, fire has typically been suppressed in the wetlands and adjoining areas to avoid losses to plantation forests. These factors have allowed forest species such as the fern <em>Staenoclina tenuifolia</em> and <em>Macaranga capensis</em> to invade. Over time, the combination of fire suppression and drying encourages the establishment of woody seedlings, turning wetlands into swamp forests and woodlands. This regime shift is more evident in wetlands which were once planted with plantation forest species with no sufficient woody plant species control to accompany the withdrawal of plantation from these wetlands.</p>","<p>Herbaceous wetlands consisting of hydrophilic grass and sedges are normally surrounded by grasslands. According to Henkel et al. (1936) the Kwambonambi area experienced regular fires, which was noted to be of great ecological importance in hindering the expansion of forest which was confined to locations protected from fire. In wetlands, hydrology is the main driver of vegetation structure, and wetlands with high levels of wetness naturally keep tree densities low. However, wetlands which are temporary to seasonally wet require fire to minimize tree densities. Therefore, high levels of wetness and regular fire in seasonally and temporarily wet wetlands were what maintained the herbaceous regime.</p> <p>Large-scale plantations have important hydrological effects, including runoff reduction and increased water table fluctuations, as well as ecological effects such as drying out of wetlands and the destruction of natural habitats (Helmschrot 2005). These effects have resulted in drying of the wetlands past their point of historic desiccation. This, in turn, has encouraged the establishment of woody seedlings in the wetlands. Combined with fire suppression this has pushed the system past the ecological threshold to maintain the herbaceous vegetation state. Woody seedlings are typically killed by fire, and in the past frequent fires would have prevented the seedlings from reaching a height where they are immune to fire. During periods of extended fire suppression, the seedlings are able to grow large enough to be able to survive a fire when it finally occurs. In addition, the swamp forest species have a low flammability and impede the spread of fire, so that once established fires becomes less frequent, further encouraging the establishment of woody seedlings, and further outcompeting the herbaceous vegetation for space and light. More generally it has been found that vegetation patterns shift spatially during decade-long dry periods with trees encroaching into herbaceous wetlands, with the frequency and severity of the fire determining the degree of shift (Kirkman 1995).</p> <p>The forest regime typically begins with fern species, particularily <em>Staenoclina tenuifolia</em>, encroaching into the wetlands and forming dense mats. Adie et al. (2011) showed that the presence of <em>Pteridium aquilinum</em> (bracken fern) aided in the transition of grassland to forest in periods of long fire suppression by providing establishment opportunities for resprouting early-successional forest species. Bracken fern is described as a landscape transformer which plays a pivotal role in montane grasslands by directing plant community development down alternative, and irreversible, successional pathways from grassland to forest (Adie et al. 2011). During periods of long fire suppression, the ferns in this case study, <em>Staenoclina tenuifolia,</em> appears to play a similar role in aiding the development of forest which they thrive under, growing to heights above a meter high. However, if management applies frequent burns, ferns would aid in increasing the fire intensity of burns, as ferns were found to burn at higher temperatures than the grass (Adie et al. 2011). Once a swamp forest is formed, fire becomes infrequent due to swamp forest species having low flammability, providing further establishment opportunities for tree seedlings.</p>","<p>Wetlands play an essential role in the water cycle and in access to water quantity and quality. In this case study, the wetlands drain into the two lakes in this region (Lake Mzingazi and Lake Nhlabane), which are important for the local municipality&rsquo;s water supply. This water recharge ability has been greatly diminished with the shift to swamp forests in many of the wetlands. Evapotranspirative loss from forested wetland is markedly higher than from grass/sedge wetland, resulting in lower water availability for downstream ecosystems and human use. Clulow et al. (2012) consistently measured much higher levels of evaporation in the swamp forest than in the sedge and grass wetland types. The regime shift has also contributed to the loss of grazing land, putting added strain on the wetlands which have not undergone a regime shift. Wetlands often have high biodiversity value, and these wetlands are no different. These wetlands are habitat to the only known wild population of the critically endangered Kniphofia leucocephala. The wetlands are also part of an endangered ecosystem type, hence the significance of conserving these wetlands. This regime shift has been favourable to the plantation companies as forests pose fewer fire risks than grasslands and herbaceous wetlands as they are less flammable, and it saves them money which they would have to pay for fire fighting labour, water and fuel. The diminished ability to recharge the lakes affects industry downstream, particularly the mining industry that utilizes large amounts of water, and municipal water supply. Although not a major concern presently given the high rainfall of the area, it could be a limiting factor in the future. With climate change, competition for water resources will intensify and the scarcity of water will increase the value of wetlands as the population increases.</p>","<p>Fire is the main reason why some of the herbaceous wetlands in this region have maintained their ecological structure and integrity. Burning the wetlands biennially, during the dry season, has been able to enhance the resilience of these wetlands to invasion by swamp forest species. Commonly, the lower the level of wetness, the more readily woody plants are able to invade a wetland area. This highlights the need for an active fire regime particularly as the wetlands are becoming drier. Another intervention would be to expand the buffer around the wetlands that have maintained their integrity. This is expected to increase the amount of water in the wetlands which will improve wetland hydrology and ultimately improve their resilience.</p> <p>Reversing the forest regime back to herbaceous wetlands requires mechanical clearing and active fire to enhance and maintain the integrity of the wetlands. Removal of hardwood forest species from wetlands can restore the herbaceous vegetation-fire feedback mechanism and ultimately restore the system to an herbaceous state (Martin &amp; Kirkman 2000). The ferns in this region contribute to high fire intensities aiding in the mortality of trees during a fire event. However, clearing established forest is typically a very expensive endeavour. It is therefore not impossible to try and restore these wetlands back to their herbaceous regimes, but would require significant resource investments.</p>","(#1) Adie H, Richert S, Kiriman KP & Lawes MJ. 2011.

This shift has been attributed to consistent overfishing, and was enhanced by large-scale environmental anomalies that occurred in the 1990s. Multiple drivers and feedbacks keep the system locked in the low biomass state. Jellyfish have exponentially grown in numbers, occupying the niche left by pelagic fish and suppressing regrowth in many stocks. Warmer sea temperatures decrease the ability for fish to spawn, keeping fish biomass low. Low fish biomass coupled with hypoxic events leads to phytoplankton blooms and reinforces the frequency and spatial scale of severe hypoxic conditions. The new, low biomass state has negatively impacted provisioning services from marine resources, regulating services maintaining marine water quality, and recreational fishing services. The loss in ecosystem services has both directly and indirectly impacted the well-being of multiple resource users within the system. Management of the system is now moving from a single-species approach towards an ecosystem-based management approach that takes into account trophic interactions as well as environmental variations affecting the system. This means, for example, setting catch limits for fisheries based on more than just fish biomass.</p>","Marine food webs","Marine & coastal","Fisheries","Sub-continental/regional (e.g. southern Africa, Amazon basin)","Africa, Atlantic Ocean","Coast off south West African continent","Namibia","Harvest and resource consumption, Environmental shocks (eg floods), Global climate change","","Marine & coastal","Primary production, Nutrient cycling","Biodiversity","Fisheries","Water purification","Recreation","Food and nutrition, Livelihoods and economic activity, Cultural, aesthetic and recreational values","","Sub-continental/regional","Years","Unknown","Models, Contemporary observations","Well established – Wide agreement in the literature that the RS exists","Well established – Wide agreement on the underlying mechanism","<p><strong>High fish biomass &ndash; pre-1990s</strong></p> <p>This regime was dominated by sardines up until the late 1960's.

These conditions combined with low fish biomass have created a beneficial niche for jellyfish (<em>Chrysaora hysoscella</em> and <em>Aequorea aequorea</em>) (Cury &amp;&nbsp;Shannon 2004) to increase in abundance (Kreiner et al. 2011). A recent study estimated the biomass of jellyfish in this region to be 2.4 times the amount of three of the most important commercial fish species combined (Roux et al. 2013).&nbsp;Seabirds and seals declined in population due to the depletion of sardine and anchovy stocks (Boyer &amp; Hampton 2001). There is evidence that some of these populations are recovering and have stabilized, although the state remains one of overall low fish biomass, in particular low sardine biomass (Boyer &amp; Hampton 2001).</p>","<p>The combined effects of overfishing and a series of large-scale environmental perturbations caused the system to shift from a high to low biomass regime (Boyer &amp; Hampton, 2001; Cury &amp;&nbsp;Shannon, 2004).&nbsp;The Benguela region has been a favored fishing ground for nearly a century (due to its fertile upwelling), although it wasn't until the 1960's that resource exploitation was intensified, with the arrival of large commercial fishing fleets (Boyer &amp;&nbsp;Hampton 2001). Sardines were targeted as the preferred species and intensively harvested - primarily for overseas markets (Boyer &amp;&nbsp;Hampton, 2001; Cury &amp;&nbsp;Shannon, 2004). The pressure on this stock effected the&nbsp;foodweb dynamics (Cury &amp;&nbsp;Shannon, 2004). Sardine stocks declined in the 1970s after which fishing was aimed primarily at anchovy in an attempt to allow sardine stocks to recover. This, however, led to a collapse of both stocks and, in the 1980s, the system became dominated by horse mackerel, bearded goby and jellyfish (de Young et al. 2004, Cury &amp;&nbsp;Shannon 2004). The top-down pressure of intense fishing, in particular on sardines, likely paved the way for a regime shift to take place by reducing ecosystem resilience to withstand perturbations (Cury &amp;&nbsp;Shannon 2004).</p> <p>Several environmental anomalies of the 1990s acted as important drivers of this shift. These periodic bottom-up pressures are natural to the system although they were of particularly large magnitude during these years (Cury &amp;&nbsp;Shannon 2004, Boyer &amp;&nbsp;Hampton 2001). In 1993/1994 a low-oxygen water event from the Angolan current caused unusually extensive hypoxia in Namibian waters (Boyer &amp; Hampton 2001; Cury &amp;&nbsp;Shannon 2004). This was followed by a Benguela Ni&ntilde;o event in 1995 (an inter-decadal climatic event) where warm, nutrient-poor water entered the system (Gammelsr&oslash;d et al. as cited in Heymans et al. 2004; Cury &amp;&nbsp;Shannon, 2004). The combination of these events led to poor recruitment conditions and high pelagic fish mortality resulting in a decline of most stocks (Heymans et al. 2004; Cury &amp;&nbsp;Shannon, 2004; Boyer &amp; Hampton, 2001).&nbsp;A general trend of warming SST in the Northern Benguela has also been identified as a potential indirect cause behind this shift although there remains some uncertainty around this, as there does around the potential contribution of other factors attributed to climate change (Bakun et al. 2010; Cury &amp; Shannon, 2004; Hutchings et al. 2009).</p>","<p>Like most upwelling systems, the Northern Benguela is dominated by a small number of species that play an important role in maintaining ecosystem structure and function (Cury &amp;&nbsp;Shannon 2004). Here, sardines are the dominant species structuring the ecosystem by performing a 'wasp-waist' control on species both above and below them in the foodweb (Cury &amp;&nbsp;Shannon 2004). Nutrient rich, cooler waters of the upwelling provides favorable conditions for phytoplankton growth, which is controlled by sardine populations and allows for an enriched trophic web supporting productive fisheries (de Young et al. 2004; Bakun et al. 2009). &nbsp;The system is vulnerable&nbsp;to periodic environmental variability (such as Benguela ni&ntilde;o events) with some years allowing better recruitment than others (Boyer &amp;&nbsp;Hampton 2001).</p> <p>Consistent fishing, particularly on sardines, creates a top-down pressure on this system reducing its resilience to environmental variability, to the point where a series of bottom-up pulses (93/94 and 95 events) pushes the system into a new dynamic regime of depleted fish biomass (Cury &amp;&nbsp;Shannon, 2004; Boyer et al. 2001; de Young et al. 2001). A key threshold, although difficult to determine in any detail, is possibly&nbsp;crossed when sardine stocks get so low that they were no longer able to maintain their populations (All&eacute;e effect), with repercussions throughout the whole foodweb. Fishing pressure continues during the poor recruitment years following the environmental perturbations most likely enhancing sardine collapse (Hutchings et al. 2009; Boyer et al. 2001.)</p> <p>The new state of depleted fish biomass is reinforced by continued fishing pressure. Decreased fish biomass allows jellyfish to consume a greater proportion of plankton, increasing the number of jellyfish (Bakun et al. 2009). This has creates a reinforcing feedback loop whereby fish stock recovery is impeded by jellyfish competition for food as well as a possible jellyfish predation on certain fish larvae (Cury &amp;&nbsp;Shannon 2004). It has been suggested that the increase of phytoplankton in the system due to less predation creates hypoxic conditions that hamper fish spawning and recruitment (Boyer et al. 2001 as cited by Cury &amp;&nbsp;Shannon, 2004).&nbsp;These feedback mechanisms appear to lock the system in this new state, potentially difficult to reverse (Cury &amp;&nbsp;Shannon 2004). There is uncertainty about the intensity and duration of low oxygen events and how these may contribute to keeping the system in this state (Hutchings et al. 2009). Warming sea temperatures may also contribute to the continuation of this state which is favorable for&nbsp;jellyfish that cope better in these conditions (Richardson et al. 2002). It is unknown how the apparent decline in upwelling intensity might affect this social-ecological system as well as whether or not this is an effect of anthropogenic climate change (Bakun et al. 2009).</p>","<p>Provisioning services decline after the shift from high biomass to low. Fish catch are plummeted, as exemplified by sardines, decreasing from 700,000 tons caught at the height of the industry to only 2,000 in 1996 (Boyer &amp;&nbsp;Hampton 2001). Seal populations also decline (Roux 1998 as cited by Cury &amp;&nbsp;Shannon 2004), possibly impacting the sealing industry. Jellyfish has direct negative economic impacts on the fishing industry, for example, spoiling fish catches and busting trawl nets (Lynam et al. 2006; Roux et al. 2013). The regulating service of water purification is negatively impacted via disruption of vital ecosystem processes necessary for maintaining a healthy water state. The cultural service of recreational fishing is reduced, as low fish biomass lead to fewer catches by anglers (Kirchner 1998 as cited in Boyer &amp;&nbsp;Hampton 2001).</p> <p>Loss of these services has unequal negative consequences on all the user groups of the resource. As a vast majority of Namibian marine catch is exported, therefore the food security of international consumers decreases (Sowman &amp;&nbsp;Cardoso 2010). However, this impact is masked by the international market (Berkes et al. 2006). Additionally, local fishers and international investors lose income from decreased fish catch (Sowman &amp;&nbsp;Cardoso 2010). Recreational fishers and few subsistence fishers were impacted by the shift, via decreasing access to recreational activities and food security, respectively (Sowman &amp;&nbsp;Cardoso 2010).</p>","<p>Prior to Namibian independence in 1990 the waters of the Northern Benguela were heavily exploited by foreign fishing fleets (Roux &amp;&nbsp;Shannon 2004; Boyer &amp;&nbsp;Hampton 2001). Management is based on single-stock assessments with the goal of increasing commercially important stocks, such as the sardine (Boyer &amp;&nbsp;Hampton 2001). Therefore focus is not on enhancing resilience of the ecosystem, but rather increasing the stocks of the socio-economically important species (Boyer et al. 2001; Boyer &amp;&nbsp;Hampton 2001). When the sardine stock initially declined in the 1960s (Boyer et al. 2001) management actions were based on observations of the Southern Benguela, where sardine domination alternates with anchovy domination. By shifting fishing pressure from the sardine to the anchovies, it was believed that sardines would recover due to decreased inter-species competition (Boyer et al. 2001; Roux &amp;&nbsp;Shannon 2004; Shannon et al. 2004). Unexpectedly, through this one-stock approach, resilience was undermined leading to an initial decline in anchovy, later followed by a decline in all other pelagic fish and no recovery of sardines (Boyer et al. 2001).</p> <p>After independence, the fishery shifted from international to local dominance (Boyer &amp;&nbsp;Hampton 2001) and the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources was established in 1991 with the mission to '[...] strengthen Namibia's position as a leading fishing nation and contribute towards the achievements of [their] economic, social and conservation goals for the benefit of all Namibians' (FAO&nbsp;2002). Great effort was directed at stopping illegal fishing (Oelofsen 1999 as cited by Roux &amp;&nbsp;Shannon 2004) and strict control on fishery vessels and in total allowable catches was implemented (Boyer &amp;&nbsp;Hampton 2001). Additionally, the Benguela Large Marine Ecosystem research programme was launched in 2002 with the aim to develop an ecosystem-wide approach to environmental research (FAO 2002). Ecosystem-based management has been proposed as a better approach to manage complex adaptive systems (Sowman &amp;&nbsp;Cardoso 2010; Roux &amp;&nbsp;Shannon 2004). It takes into account trophic interactions as well as environmental variations effecting fish spawning and fish recruitment to set appropriate target exploitation rates for fisheries. Future management of exploited fisheries must also be flexible enough to deal with delayed responses to environmental perturbations transferred across scales. Successful management of marine ecosystem thus requires research traversing various disciplines as well as coordination and cooperation at national and international levels (Hofmann &amp;&nbsp;Powell 1998).&nbsp;After decades of declining fish stocks, signs of recovery are evident in several of Namibia's marine resources but sardine biomass has yet to recover (Boyer &amp;&nbsp;Hampton 2001). With regards to current management, it is still unknown what sustainable harvest levels should be in order to maintain the ecological stability and resilience of the system.

The Black Sea experienced the following regimes:</p> <p><strong>Top predator dominated regime (until the 1950's)</strong></p> <p>This regime is described by low phytoplankton abundance, moderate to high abundance of zooplankton, low abundance of native gelatinous plankton (mainly the cnidarian <em>A. aurita</em>), low to moderate stocks of pelagic fish as sprat and anchovy, and high stocks of predator fish species as bonito, bluefish and mackerel. This top predator dominated regime is characterized by low fishing pressure, low levels of nutrients in the water column and well-oxygenated and clear waters.</p> <p><strong>Gelatinous plankton dominated regime (from early 1960's to present)</strong></p> <p>This regime is described by high phytoplankton abundance, low to moderate abundance of zooplankton, high abundance of gelatinous plankton (mainly the invasive ctenophore <em>M. leidyi</em>) leading to occasional blooms, low stocks of pelagic fish as sprat and anchovy, &nbsp;and low stocks (or even disappearance) of top predator fish species. This gelatinous plankton dominated regime is associated with eutrophication due to high concentration of phytoplankton and nutrients in the water column, therefore increasing the water turbidity and decreasing dissolved oxygen in the water.</p>","<p>The Black Sea shifted from being a top predator dominated system, to a gelatinous plankton one, due to the combined effects of a series of external driving forces and a strong shock, the introduction of an invasive jellyfish.&nbsp;The main driving force diminishing the response capacity of the system was the strong fishing activity due to increasing food demand, which had an effect on the population stock of predatory and pelagic fish and a consequent alteration of the dynamics in the food web (top-down control).&nbsp; The second key force was the increase of nutrient input due to the runoff from agricultural and urban activities, increasing the availability of nutrients in the water column of the sea and consequently raising the amount of phytoplankton and enhancing water turbidity (bottom-up dominance). Closely related to the nutrient input rise was the increase in the number of water mixing events as a response to more severe winters caused by global climate change, enhancing the availability of nutrients.</p> <p>The fragility of the system due to the effect of the main drivers was demonstrated by a first outburst of the native gelatinous plankton species (<em>A. aurita</em>) by the end of the 1970's.&nbsp;By the early 1980's an invasive gelatinous plankton species (<em>M. leidyi</em>) was introduced in the system by means of evacuated ballast waters from ships arriving from outside areas. This species rapidly outnumbered the local gelatinous plankton (<em>A. aurita</em>) and the pelagic fish competing for zooplankton, setting itself as an important shock, rapidly allowing a shift to a gelatinous plankton regime dominated by a species with no natural predators.</p>","<p>Under conditions of low fishing pressure and nutrient input, the Black Sea was dominated by top predators until the 1950's. High population of pelagic fish, which feed on gelatinous plankton<em> A. aurita</em>, kept the populations of this species in check. In addition, low nutrients limited the growth of phytoplankton.</p> <p>Overfishing over a period of approximately 40 years reduced the population stock of pelagic fish, reducing the competition for zooplankton with gelatinous plankton, therefore weakening the top-down dynamics in the food web. At the same time, the bottom-up dynamics of the system were altered by the increased nutrient input, which enhanced turbidity and the growth of phytoplankton and facilitated a connected increase in zooplankton. Under these circumstances the system lost resilience and the accidental introduction of an invasive and highly competitive species of gelatinous plankton (<em>M. leidyi</em>), became the disturbance which pushed the system over a tipping point towards a gelatinous plankton dominated regime. <em>M. leidyi</em> took advantage of low pelagic fish population and high abundance of zooplankton to increase its population and dominance over the system.</p> <p>The gelatinous plankton dominated regime is characterized by eutrophic and turbid waters, high concentration of nutrients and high fishing pressure. The most important feature of this regime is the high concentration of the invasive ctenophore<em> M. leidyi</em>, and the low abundance of pelagic fish. This regime is maintain by 1) the reinforcement feedback between <em>M. leidyi</em> and pelagic fish, as the M. leidyi feeds on the pelagic fish's larvae; 2) <em>M. leidyi</em> competes better than pelagic fish when the concentrations of zooplankton increase and 3) <em>M. leidyi</em> is a better competitor than<em> A. aurita</em> for zooplankton. These three facts, associated with the impacts of the external main drivers on the system, keep high concentrations of <em>M. leidyi</em> and maintain the system within this regime.</p>","<p>The intensified fishing pressure in the gelatinous plankton dominated regime provides a high value on food provision given that more fish is harvested and actually used while decreasing the other ecosystem services found before the shift. The collapse of top predators and an increased pressure on pelagic fish causes a direct impact on biodiversity, in terms of species diversity (changes in species richness and evenness) while the booms of gelatinous plankton, especially in coastal areas, may impact on aesthetic and recreational values. The increase of nutrient input from agriculture and sewage has a direct impact on the nutrient cycling function, enhanced by a higher frequency of mixing events in cooler winters.</p> <p>Human well-being is impacted positively in terms of food and nutrition for those potential consumers of the Black Sea fisheries, while livelihoods and economic activity is enhanced at a global scale through fisheries enterprises harvesting in the sea, regardless of their origin. Cultural, aesthetical and recreational values are reduced for those inhabitants of the coastline and potential tourists, while livelihoods and tourist dependant economic activities in the region are also affected.</p>","<p>No measures were taken to prevent the regime shift. However the main actions that could have been taken to enhance resilience should have aimed to avoid overfishing of predatory and especially pelagic fish. Being a top-down dominated system, it is important to identify keystone species in top trophic levels of the Black Sea and manage for them. Properly enforced fishing regulations leads to healthy fish populations, hence balanced primary production. On the other hand, nutrient load in the Black Sea could have been controlled to avoid eutrophication.</p> <p>The Black Sea is a complex dynamic system with multiple linkages and mechanisms. Therefore, more than one action is required to encourage restoration. Currently, the system presents low phytoplankton production and increasing stocks of small pelagic fish. This was achieved by reducing fishing pressure, decreasing nutrient load originated from farming and sewage in the Black Sea Basin, and reducing populations of the invasive species <em>M. leidyi</em> through the introduction of the ctenophore <em>B. ovata</em> which feeds on <em>M. leidyi</em>. Warming hydroclimate is also leading to a restoration of the desirable regime.</p> <p>Since the ecosystem is showing signs of hysteresis, more active intervention that considers well-implemented cross-scale and adaptive ecosystem-based management is required to avoid switching back to an undesirable regime. Therefore management actions should include enforcement of fishing regulations that consider location and time of year where/when fish spawning and reproduction take place, restrictions regarding fishing gear, and establishment of fishing quotas and economic alternatives for fishermen. It is also required to enforce regional policies that aim for a shift to the use of organic fertilizers, agroforestry and mechanisms to treat sewage.</p>","(#1) Daskalov, G, Grishin, A, Rodionov, S, & Mihneva, V. 2007.

The dam was originally designed for irrigation which is still its primary use. Hartbeespoort Dam has been renowned for its poor water quality since the mid twentieth century (Allanson & Gieskes 1961). The Dam suffers severe eutrophication, resulting from high concentrations of phosphates and nitrates in the Crocodile River, the major inflow.

"376","2012-10-20 00:00:00","Goulburn-Broken Catchment, Australia","Reinette (Oonsie) Biggs","","<p>Around 85% of the native woodland and forest cover has been removed from the mid catchment of the Goulburn-Broken, and 98% from the lower catchment (GBCMA 2003). Anderies et al. (2006b) estimate that the cover of woody vegetation was reduced to below the threshold level needed to maintain the water table below the surface about a decade after clearing began. This threshold is estimated at about 80% vegetation cover in the mid catchment (groundwater in the upper catchment appears not to be connected to water tables in the mid and lower catchment). As water tables rise in response to the reduced vegetation cover, there is a critical threshold at around 2&nbsp;m below the surface (depending on soil texture). When the water table rises above this, capillary action draws water to the surface. The height of the water table determines the area salinized because of topographic variation, so area salinized and water-table depth are treated as a single threshold. Because of a strong hysteresis effect (tree roots do not function well in saturated soil, so it takes more trees than in unsaturated soil to achieve the same amount of transpiration), more than 80% of the catchment needs to be revegetated to change the trajectory of the system such that the equilibrium water-table depth is below the root zone. As this would affect large areas of dryland farms, pumping is needed in addition to revegetation—the less revegetation, the more pumping (see Anderies et al. 2006b). A constraint is the large volumes of saline water produced. Almost twice as much saline water needs to be pumped if there is no revegetation, which would violate the current salt discharge cap. Revegetation and pumping are both costly.

Since the 1970s the system was characterized by two types of livestock production: 1) mixed crop production in rotation with pastures was practiced in the western Litoral and 2) pastoral grazing based on natural grasslands with low external inputs and low-stocking density on poor, erosive soils in the rest of the country. The Uruguayan agricultural system was transformed into a new regime in about 2002, where a new productive system of continuous cultivation of soybeans with other crops emerged. The change was driven by several external forces, starting with an increased demand for animal products, mainly in China. This increased demand for animal feed crops for Asian domestic production contributed to increasing global soybean prices. When farmers showed profitable margins, soybeans became a lucrative option, which in turn drove a huge increase in Uruguayan land prices. This negatively affected economic margins in extensive livestock and intensive soy production became more economically attractive. The abrupt shift from ranching to cropping was catalyzed by a mass infusion of capital and technology from Argentina. Economic crisis in Argentina led actors with capital and knowledge and experience of the new agricultural technology package for no-till soybean production to enter an equally financially distressed Uruguay. The combination of advantageous economic margins, ecologically appropriate technology and necessary capital for this capital intensive production system combined to overwhelm previous Uruguayan resistance (strong cultural identity) to changing farming systems from ranchers to crop farmers in the Litoral region. Within only a few years, large-scale expansion of crop cultivations further affected the livestock sector as the most productive grazing areas were taken for crop production. Since economic margins for crop production were so much higher, the livestock sector lost producers and lands to crop production. Owners who did change farming systems left Litoral or went out of business. Most traditional sharecroppers lost access to land and many became service providers. One of the major ecological consequences of the adopted system is that continuous cropping degrades soil productivity due to decreased soil organic matter and increased risk of erosion. The government has taken steps to mitigate soil degradation by enforcing the existing Soil Law. However, soil degradation has not been stopped only slowed.","Extensive ranching to crop production","Grasslands, Agro-ecosystems","Small-scale subsistence crop cultivation, Large-scale commercial crop cultivation, Intensive livestock production (eg feedlots, dairies), Extensive livestock production (natural rangelands)","Local/landscape (e.g. lake, catchment, community)","South America","Litoral – western Uruguay","Uruguay","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(#1) Bot, A., and J.

The Nile perch, an introduced species, remained a minor component of the lake's cichlid-dominated fauna for more than two decades after its introduction. This regime was maintained by feedbacks between the cichlids and phytoplankton, preventing the lake from oxygen depletion, as well as feedbacks between the cichlids and Nile perch juveniles, controlling the Nile perch population. Human population growth indirectly caused both increased fishing pressure on the cichlids and nutrient input to the lake, eventually leading to the regime shift in the 1980s. The new regime is especially upheld by feedbacks between the Nile perch and cichlids as the latter are the preferred feed of the Nile perch. The ecosystem service impacted the most by the regime shift was fishery, changing from a local and more gender-equalized system to a large-scale international fishing business with local inequalities. For management interventions, the focus is not on reversing the regime shift, but rather on improving social conditions in the lake surroundings.&nbsp;</p>","Cichlid dominated state to Nile Perch dominated state","Freshwater lakes & rivers","Small-scale subsistence crop cultivation, Large-scale commercial crop cultivation, Extensive livestock production (natural rangelands), Timber production, Fisheries, Tourism","Local/landscape (e.g. lake, catchment, community)","Africa","Eastern Africa","Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya","Vegetation conversion and habitat fragmentation, Harvest and resource consumption, External inputs (eg fertilizers), Adoption of new technology, Species introduction or removal, Environmental shocks (eg floods)","","","Primary production, Nutrient cycling","Biodiversity","Freshwater, Fisheries","","Recreation, Aesthetic values, Knowledge and educational values","Food and nutrition, Health (eg toxins, disease), Livelihoods and economic activity, Cultural, aesthetic and recreational values, Social conflict","","Local/landscape","Years","Unknown","Models, Contemporary observations","Well established – Wide agreement in the literature that the RS exists","Well established – Wide agreement on the underlying mechanism","<p><strong>Cichlid dominated regime (1950s &ndash; 1980s)</strong></p> <p>The regime was characterized by a lake&nbsp;of high biodiversity dominated by different species of native haplochromine cichlids (Balirwa et al. 2003; UNEP 2010). Cichlids span over many different trophic levels and represent nearly all different functional groups in Lake Victoria (UNEP 2010). In this regime the lake was less eutrophic compared to the current regime and thus less turbid. Nile perch was already introduced to the lake but populations remained low.</p> <p>In the lake basin there were many local communities living on subsistence farming and small-scale fishing (Swallow 2009). The native fish species provided food for the local communities and the fishing for native cichlids was non-commercial but still population growth in the region put a large pressure on the native fish stocks (Seehausen et al. 1997).</p> <p><strong>Nile perch-dominated regime (From 1980s)</strong></p> <p>In this current regime the system has much reduced biodiverse lake with high abundance of only three species, the dominant Nile perch <em>Lates niloticus</em>, Nile tilapia <em>Oreochromis niloticu</em>s (Balirwa et al. 2003), and a native cyprinid <em>Rastrineobola argentea</em> (UNEP 2010). The cyprinid is competing for the same resources as some cichlids (Matsuishi et al. 2006) and thus became very abundant once the cichlids disappeared. This low diversity makes the system vulnerable to disturbances (Balirwa et al. 2003; UNEP 2010). Eutrophication is an ever increasing problem resulting in algae blooms, turbidity, and hypoxia (Balirwa et al. 2003), all of which are undesirable conditions for the native species.</p> <p>The fishing of Nile perch created a global market for fish export. The fishing industries involved many from the local communities and there was an increase in income for those in the Nile perch business. However, the changes brought many social problems emerging from unequal distribution of the increased income (Geheb et al. 2008).&nbsp;</p>","<p>The apparent extinction of several hundreds of cichlid species was caused by Nile perch predation (Goudswaard&nbsp;et al.&nbsp;2008). However, this event was preceded by drivers that weakened the cichlid population and opened up the field for the Nile perch. One of the main drivers was the increased pressure on the Lake Victoria cichlids by fisheries. At the beginning of the 1980s, cichlids accounted for more than 90 percent of the catch (Balirwa 2007). The other main driver was the increase in nutrient input from the Lake Victoria surroundings, leading to instances of algae blooms and hypoxia. The deoxygenation created an environment which was not suitable for the cichlids, many of which inhabited lower water columns where the oxygen deficiency was most acute (Hecky et al. 1994). The increase in nutrient inputs also caused turbidity which contributed to the reduction of reproductive capacity among cichlids (Seehausen et al. 1997).</p> <p>The underlying driver of both of these developments is the&nbsp;human population growth around the lake, accelerating fishery activities and off-shore developments such as deforestation and expansion of agriculture which fed the lake with nutrient run-offs (Ibid.).&nbsp;Another cause of the demise of the cichlids was the heavy rainfall events during the 1960s. This external shock destroyed littoral vegetation around the lake which had served as important spawning and nursery grounds for native species. This enabled another species, the Nile tilapia, to conquer some of these areas and outcompete cichlids (Kaufman 1992). At this time the system was resilient enough to avert a shift but these events were precursors to later developments.&nbsp;</p>","<p>Under the cichlid dominated regime, Lake Victoria was an ecosystem with high species diversity. By eating basically everything in the lake these cichlids performed tight internal recycling (Kaufman 1992) and the pelagic planktivorous and detritivorous cichlids occupied a significant role in protecting the system against the excess production of phytoplankton (Goldschmidt et al. 1993). This allowed allowed&nbsp;resilience against&nbsp;increased nutrient input. The dominance of the cichlids also suppressed other species, including the Nile perch. The cichlids fed upon Nile perch larvae and competed with Nile perch juveniles for space and food (Goudswaard et al.&nbsp;2008). These dynamics might explain why it took the Nile perch decades to accomplish its virtual takeover of the lake; as long as the cichlids were abundant, the Nile perch reproduction was suppressed (Ibid.).</p> <p>However, due to the combined threats of Nile perch predation, overfishing, and the increasing nutrient inputs, this changed. First, the overfishing severely reduced the cichlid population in certain areas. Once the cichlid stock was reduced the Nile perch juveniles were able to colonize the areas. From there on, the Nile perch population could grow, invade neighboring areas, reduce the cichlids, and open up new areas for the recruitment of Nile perch juveniles (Ibid.). In this new regime, the Nile perch was the dominator and cichlids then dominated. When the cichlids started to disappear, this situation was opportunistically exploited by other species, including native shrimps. In the absence of the cichlids the shrimp population grew massively and became the most important source of food for the Nile perch (Kaufman 1992, Goldschmidt et al.&nbsp;1993).</p> <p>The reduction of cichlids, in combination with the spike in nutrient input, in turn had detrimental effects on the nutrient recycling, resulting in hypoxia. Those cichlids which had inhabited the lower water columns, and had therefore avoided Nile perch, were forced to migrate to shallow waters to escape the hypoxic waters. In these shallow waters they became the target of Nile perch predation (Hecky et al. 1994).&nbsp;</p>","<p>Both before and after the regime shift, Lake Victoria has been providing important provisioning ecosystem services, primarily fisheries. Before the shift, these fisheries were run by small-scale fishermen and operators; women were largely involved in the business (Abila &amp;&nbsp;Jansen 1997), and the fish was for local consumption. However, the Nile perch boom diminished the variety of native fish, and turned this food source into economically more valuable forms of fish meat (Geheb et al. 2008). Foreign investment brought processing plants to the lake's shores (Kaufman 1992), boosted fish export, and eventually turned the artisanal fishery into a large-scale international enterprise. Another provisioning ecosystem service, namely the provision of freshwater suffered from decreased water quality through the cichlids' disappearance (Kaufman 1992).</p> <p>Cultural ecosystem services were gained in terms of (fishing) tourism but presumably lost in terms of ecosystem/biodiversity knowledge, and aesthetic values.&nbsp;Since the regime shift, the majority of local community members have been carrying out economic activities linked to the Nile Perch fishery. The livelihood for many has improved (Abila &amp; Jansen 1997). However, income from the fishing industry has been unequally distributed (Geheb et al. 2008). Due to social gender inequalities mainly men have been drawing profits from the fisheries boom while women and children have often been victims of malnutrition which is high along the lake's shores (ibid.). Many women have been forced into prostitution which in turn has increased the number of HIV/Aids infections after the Nile perch boom (Appleton 2000).&nbsp;</p>","<p>The Nile perch was introduced in Lake Victoria to improve the commercial fishing values (Balirwa et al. 2003). The social effects from this have had huge and diverse impacts on the local communities around the lake resulting in, on one side, a billion dollar export industry, and on the other side, malnutrition, unequally divided income, and increased spread of HIV/Aids (B&eacute;n&eacute; &amp; Merten 2007, Appleton 2000). Nothing was done to prevent the shift from the cichlid dominated regime to the Nile perch dominated regime in the 1980s.&nbsp;Currently there are many different projects that work across the Lake Victoria Basin. The Lake Victoria Basin Commission (LVBC) is an institution of the East African Community which coordinates the policy and management agenda for the region (LVBC 2011). The program works for local community participation, poverty reduction and environmental concerns. Health issues, especially HIV/Aids (LVFO 2011) and human well-being are the most important parts of many different projects working in the lake surroundings.&nbsp;Some projects in the Kenyan part of the Lake Victoria basin mentioned by Swallow 2009 are the TransVic project byWorld Agroforestry Center, the Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project and Vi Agroforestry (Swallow 2003 and 2009). These are all focusing on land degradation and agroforestry as land use management methods which both reduce the nutrient input to improve the lake conditions and work for poverty reduction (ibid.).&nbsp;</p> <p>A return to a regime with low abundance of Nile perch is not the focus of management and action plans (Schindler et al. 1998, Kitchell 1997) since the economic value of the Nile perch is so important. The ecological focus is rather on restoration of biodiversity, the lake ecosystem services, and the sustainability of the fisheries in the lake.&nbsp;A sustainable fishing of Nile perch can be reached by the control of fishing practices(Seehausen et al. 1997a). A study by Schindler et al. in 1998 show that by using a minimum mesh size of 5-inches the Nile perch cannibalism and the predation of native species can be reduced by 44% at the same time as the catches of Nile perch is only reduced by 10%.&nbsp;The re-emergence of native cichlids is an important step in the lake management to restore biodiversity in the lake system. By continuing the fishing of Nile perch the species is held at a controlled level giving the cichlids an opportunity to return to the system. For this it is also of great importance to improve the lake conditions by reducing the leakage of nutrients into the lake e.g. through investments in sewage treatment and restoration of wetlands in the basin area (Balirwa et al. 2003).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","(#1) Abila, R. and Jansen, E. 1997.

Physical changes include intensification of the wintertime Aleutian Low pressure system, change in Pacific-North America (PNA) teleconnection pattern, and regional cooling or warming. The 1977 climate shift is associated with an abrupt transition from a negative to positive phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). In 1989, a new regime shift occurred characterized by declining fish stocks, but the changes were not as remarkable or pervasive as in the 1976-77, and the changes caused not a return of the system back to the pre-1977 conditions. The 1976-77 and 1989 North Pacific Ocean climatic regime shifts were caused by natural shifts in ocean climate.

The central North Pacific Ocean and northwest Pacific Ocean now began to cool, and the northeast and subarctic Pacific Ocean to warm.</p> <p>Such changes clearly influenced the primary and secondary production in the North Pacific, although there are regional variations. Generally speaking, the trophic level changes include increases in phytoplankton and zooplankton, changes in fish species composition and declines in subarctic top predator populations. The response of salmon to such changes is very species-specific and can therefore not be generalized. However, several studies suggest that the North Pacific sardine and anchovy stocks vary naturally in decadal cycles due to cold and warm periods: the warm sardine regime (intensification of Aleutian Low pressure) switches to a cold, anchovy dominated regime (relaxation of the Aleutian Low) every ca 25 years. An anchovy regime ended in 1975 and a sardine regime occurred from 1975 to mid-1990s.</p> <p><strong>Declining fish production regime (1989 &ndash; (possibly) 1998)</strong></p> <p>The 1977 regime shift had an almost equal balance in fish abundance, as the stocks both increased and decreased, whereas in 1989 the ecological changes consisted largely of widespread declines in productivity. Physical changes include intensification of the winter and summer Arctic vortex, weakened winter Aleutian low and subarctic circulation, and summer warming throughout most of the central North Pacific and coastal northeast Pacific Ocean. The sea surface temperature (SST) change in the Northern Pacific occurred concurrently with the SST change in the tropical Pacific during the 1976-77 climate transition period, but in the 1989 climate transition, the SST change was limited to the North Pacific.</p> <p>Warming occurred in the Central North Pacific Ocean, in the Kuroshio-Oyashio system and in the California Current. However a, winter cooling of the coastal waters took place in the northern Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea. The Kuroshio Current slowed down and wind stress and vertical mixing decreased, leading to earlier spring phytoplankton blooms. In the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea, the 1989 regime shift was associated with some of the lowest salmon catches in the history of the Canadian fishery. The nutrient concentrations and biological production decreased in all four regions.&nbsp;Based on the climate and ocean indices, a 'new' ocean climate regime began in 1998. However, the overall biological consequences are still unknown, since not all ecosystems have responded to the 1998 regime shift.&nbsp;</p>","<p>The North Pacific regime shifts are probably caused by climatic variations. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), an interdecadal climate variability, refers to the cyclical variations of SSTs in the whole North Pacific Ocean. Both the strong 1976-77 and the weaker 1989 regime shifts were most probably caused by the change in the PDO patterns.</p> <p>During warmer periods, abundant zooplankton support strong recruitment of both forage and predatory fishes, which in turn control forage fish. At the onset of a new cold regime, the biomass of predators remain high and predation continues to control the biomass of forage fish, but bottom up processes begin to limit fish recruitment. Some fish species in the Gulf of Alaska may have experienced a shift between bottom-up control in the 1980s (high production) and top down control.&nbsp;</p>","<p>Changes in the PDO patterns most probably caused the two regime shifts.&nbsp;During the 1976-77 regime shift, deepening and eastward shift of the Aleutian Low caused the warm, moist air to move over Alaska and cold air over the North Pacific Ocean. It caused large changes in the patterns of surface-heat flux, ocean current advection, turbulent mixing and horizontal transport. Strong mid-ocean upwelling is believed to increase productivity, and the associated horizontal divergence transports nutrients and plankton into coastal areas. These phenomena may have been responsible for the improved overall productivity in the North Pacific in the 1980s. Plankton production is positively correlated with fish production and there was a general increase in plankton during the 1980s.</p> <p>Variations in salinity and SST affected zooplankton and fish abundance and their recruitment. The responses of the marine mammals and sea birds to regime shifts are difficult to estimate because of the human influence, complex natural responses to natural phenomena and delayed or muted response.&nbsp;Although the 1976-77 and 1989 regime shifts were caused by natural climate variability, the response of the fish may have been influenced by humans. Overfishing may have caused changes in community structure, fish age structure and energy cycling, and this may have alter the response of the fish to the otherwise natural regime shift. The disentangle of the climate effect and the overfishing is difficult.&nbsp;</p>","<p>The 1976-77 and 1989 regime shifts affected humans mainly through changes in the provisioning ecosystem services. The 1976-77 regime shift fisheries response was nearly balanced with variations in species biomasses but in the post-1989 regime there were widespread declines in fish stocks (for regional variations, see Ecosystem services at level 3).&nbsp;Around the time of the 1976-77 regime shift there were regional variations in the phytoplankton and zooplankton biomasses. The bottom-up regulation of overall productivity in the North Pacific Ocean appears to be closely related to the upper ocean changes characteristic to the positive PDO.</p> <p>Changes in fish stocks affected human societies directly through seafood availability and economy, and indirectly by decreasing the ecosystem stability through declines in species richness, genetic diversity and productivity. Fish, marine mammals, sea birds and shellfish have been essential resources for the North Pacific native people. Especially declines in the salmon stocks affected negatively the livelihoods of the indigenous human societies for which salmon forms a cultural core of traditions, economy, food, health and even religious beliefs&nbsp;</p>","<p>As the 1976-77 and 1989 regime shifts were caused by natural climatic changes, the changes in food web can chiefly be influenced through maintaining the natural resilience against the future climate changes. It seems very likely that the PDO will continue to change polarity every few decades as it has done over the past century, and with it the abundance of salmon and other species sensitive to environmental conditions will change in the North Pacific. It is believed that the buffering impact of species diversity on the resilience of an ecosystem generates security in economy and ecosystem management.</p> <p>Marine reserves and fisheries closures may increase species diversity and consequently fish production. The resilience of fish populations to regime shifts caused by natural climate variability can probably be maintained by managing fish stocks in a way that doesn't alter the sensitivity of the marine systems to climate variability. Eliminating locally adapted species by overfishing may decrease the stability of a marine ecosystem and its ability to recover in a changing environment. Various studies have looked at&nbsp;what constitutes an optimum management strategy for fisheries that undergo regime shifts. The disadvantage of regime-specific harvest rate strategy (see: Leverage points at Level 3) is that scaling down from the high fishing capacity after the high biomass regime would most probably cause difficult economic and social problems. Also, if the low biomass is overestimated, the stock might be overharvested.&nbsp;The North Pacific fisheries are not managed as one unit. Regional, cooperative resource management is important in international marine ecosystems with migratory fish species. Some studies propose that a new management institution should be created for the North Pacific Ocean to do research on ecological interactions, to create a framework for decision-making and to ensure equal benefits.&nbsp;</p>","(#1) Alexander M, Capotondi A, Miller A, Chai F, Brodeur R, Deser C. 2008.

Shifts in the tributary channels caused by silting up in the river mouth because of deposition of sediment which heightened the channel floor. Headward deposition as well as the formation of superlobes was also a driver for channel shifts in the tributaries. Superlobes can either be a result of lower channel shifts through movement of the river mouth or a result of formation of several delta lobes which in turn are caused tributary channel shifts (reinforcing feedback). The shifts in the lower river channel and in the distributaries led to complicated imbrication. Moreover, changes in the coastlines, and sea water depth took place because of these river channel shifts. Lower river channel shifts were brought under artificial control by dykes, or under natural conditions by formation of large crevasses due to deposition of sediment. A large crevasse was for example formed in 1855 and in 1128 a dyke was destroyed to check the advance of the Jin army.</p>","River Channel Position","Freshwater lakes & rivers","Urban, Small-scale subsistence crop cultivation, Fisheries","Local/landscape (e.g. lake, catchment, community)","Asia","Shandong Province, China","China, People's Republic of","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(#1) Xue C. 1993.

One explanation is a change in discharge because of changes in rainfall characteristics, population growth, and land use change. Another hypothesis focuses on the occurrence of exceptionally strong flood events. Natural evolution of meanders without chaotic behaviour might also explain the cutoffs.

A 71 km meander loop was cut-off and created a 33-47 km2 large oxbow lake. Besides flood events, especially those in 1997 when the cutoff occurred, the shift was mainly driven by human actions from the late 1980s onward. Residents from nearby upstream villages removed debris and cut vegetation along a small flood channel across the meander neck (where the cutoff took place) in order to improve transit and to establish a toll system. From the 1900s the channel and its connection to a floodplain lake have been used as a shortcut for canoes. A third reason for the cut off of vegetation was to facilitate bank erosion. Later, the channel was systematically maintained and widened with machetes, axes and shovels. Shallow, circular pits were excavated that acted as scour holes and in 1997 even a tractor was used to widen the entrance to the channel. The Masisea cut-off had significant impacts on the ecology and the economy upstream and downstream of the location at which it occurred. Upstream impacts consisted of a decrease in flood events, flood levels, travel time and transportation costs, which led to new economic opportunities such as changes in subsistence crops (e.g. plantain and maize) and cash crops that generated a higher income for people living upstream (e.g. papaya). In addition, the new economic opportunities upstream supported in-migration. However, downstream impacts consisted of an increase in flood events, flood levels, riverbed aggradation, bank erosion, lateral channel shifts and stranded communities. These impacts in turn led to a heightened vulnerability in floodplain agriculture, so that people increased their reliance on fishing and shifted their land-use from perennial to annual crops. Furthermore, the negative impacts led to upstream migration.&nbsp;</p>","River Channel Position","Freshwater lakes & rivers","Small-scale subsistence crop cultivation, Fisheries","Local/landscape (e.g. lake, catchment, community)","South America","Ucayali, Peru","Peru","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(#1) Coomes OT, Abizaid C, Lapointe M. 2009.

They were created in 1957 (Veluwemeer) and 1969 (Wolderwijd) for the purpose of serving as flood polders. Both lakes are shallow and have an average water depth of 1.5 meters. They have been eutrophic since 1957 and 1969. This case study deals with the regime shift from a submerged plant dominated system of Potamogeton pectinatus and Potamogeton perfoliatus to 'meadows' of Charophytes, (especially Chara spp.) in Lake Veluwemeer and Lake Wolderwijd that happened between 1987 and 1993. Potamogeton pectinatus, better known as fennel pondweed, is a submerged plant that has 2 mm wide, dense, long and linear leaves. Potamogeton perfoliatus, also known as clasping-leaf pondweed, is a submerged plant with oval, translucent leaves with no stalk that can be up to 8 cm long. Charophytes are a division of green freshwater algaes that have large thalli (which means they have no organized and distinct parts such as leafs, roots or stems) which can grow up to 120 cm. Chara spp., also known as Stonewort, is a rapidly growing submerged plant, which grows on the bottom of a lake with its roots attached to the sediment. Water depth and turbidity, which affect the availability of in situ light, seem to be the main drivers for the shift from the regime dominated by Potamogeton pectinatus and Potamogeton perfoliatus to the Chara spp. dominated regime. However, this is speculative because it is not clear whether luxuriant air plant growth, high turbulence, nutrients and grazing by herbivorous birds had an impact on the shift, too.&nbsp;</p>","Submerged to Floating Plants","Freshwater lakes & rivers","Large-scale commercial crop cultivation, Intensive livestock production (eg feedlots, dairies)","Local/landscape (e.g. lake, catchment, community)","Europe","Province Flevoland, Province Gelderland","Netherlands","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(#1) Coops H, Doef RW. 1996.

Hypoxia was first documented in the northern Gulf of Mexico in 1972. It is caused primarily by algal production stimulated by the excess nutrients delivered to Gulf waters from the Mississippi—Atchafalaya River drainage basin, in combination with the stratification of Gulf waters. The Mississippi river and Gulf oceanography create a strongly stratified system each year and if storms don't mix the waters, the bottom is isolated from aeration until fall. Other factors contributing to the Gulf of Mexico hypoxia are changes in landscape use and coastal wetland loss.</p> <p>The mid-summer area of bottom hypoxia in 1985-1992 averaged 8000-9000km2 and increased up to 16 000 – 20 000km2 in 1993-2000. Spatial and temporal variety in the distribution of hypoxia are at least partially related to the amplitude and phasing of the river discharges and their nutrient flux. Mississippi river nutrient concentrations and loadings to the continental shelf have accelerated dramatically since the 1950s. Hypoxia occurs not only in the bottom near the sediments but well up into the water column.</p> <p>The fishery resources of the Gulf are among the most valuable in the United States. Motile fish and crustaceans are generally absent from the hypoxic bottoms and other invertebrates die or show stress behavior in anoxic areas. Studies have shown that areas with persistent and severe hypoxia have more reduced abundance, species richness and biomass than the areas with intermittent and less severe hypoxia. Effects on hypoxia on fish include direct mortality, altered migration, reduction in suitable habitats, increased susceptibility to predation (including fishing by humans), changes in food resources and disruption of life cycles.</p> <p>It has been suggested that the large hypoxic regions are not likely to have occurred prior to the 1970s, and that the size of those regions grew to a maximum in the 1980s and has then fluctuated between the mid-1980s and present. An action plan for reducing, mitigating and controlling hypoxia in the Gulf include a goal of reducing the average area of the hypoxic zone to below 5000km2 by 2015.</p> <p>The BP oil spill in 2010 may affect dissolved oxygen content in numerous ways, e.g. create more deep water dead zones and deplete oxygen in water, but the Gulf of Mexico reaction to the oil spill is still uncertain.&nbsp;</p>","Hypoxia","Marine & coastal","Fisheries","Sub-continental/regional (e.g. southern Africa, Amazon basin)","North America","Middle America","Mexico, United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(#1) Rabalais NN, Turner RE, Dortch Q, Justic D, Bierman VJ Jr., Wiseman WJ Jr. 2002.

In the 1980s the hypoxic and anoxic conditions covered most of the bay bottom with year-to-year variation. To some extent, hypoxia in the Chesapeake Bay is natural since the bay has a large catchment area, seasonally stratified water mass and isolated basins. Opinions differ on the degree to which hypoxia has worsened due to eutrophication, but it is clear that hypoxia intensified greatly between the mid-1950s and mid-1980s, which is the period when human population in the Chesapeake Bay watershed nearly doubled and the use of inorganic fertilizers nearly tripled.</p> <p>Chesapeake Bay is particularly susceptible to dysfunction from eutrophication. Compared with other marine ecosystems, the bay has higher primary production than would be predicted from known nutrient inputs. The size of the bay, material residence times, and tidal and non-tidal circulation lead to a greater recycling and reuse of nutrients. Large quantities of sessile benthic biota die during summer hypoxia and anoxia. Although some species migrate, fall recolonization may fail and cause changes in communal dominance. Migration of fish may also cause fish declines as available food supply and space decline.

It is relatively shallow and gets water inflows from the Atlantic Ocean, Baltic Sea and from rivers and land run-off. Low oxygen contents occur naturally in the North Sea due to the thermohaline stratification; particularly shallow areas with seasonal stratification are vulnerable to oxygen depletion in the bottom layer. The North Sea ecosystems are normally capable of responding to the large natural year to year variability (e.g. heavy storms, shifts in prevailing winds, different water inflows) and maintain sufficient resilience to continue to function, but when anthropogenic stress is added to these natural phenomena, the system may drift away from its' natural state.</p> <p>The North Sea, especially the southern part, is one of the most polluted seas in the world: large amounts of waste and discharges have led to eutrophication especially on the coastal areas and on the areas with restricted water exchange in combination with weak tides. Eutrophication has indirectly led to oxygen depletion. In the 80s the oxygen content, the duration and the extent of the oxygen depletion became alarming. The low oxygen concentrations of 1981-83 have been suggested to be caused by combination of meteorological and hydrographic conditions and eutrophication.</p> <p>Episodic hypoxia has resulted in the death of the bottom fauna, dead fish, changes in fish size structure and fish migration away from the affected areas. It has been estimated that during severe hypoxia the fish biomass was approximately 2% of the recorded biomass of the non-hypoxic conditions.

The deep waters were oxygenated with generally large volumes of inflow water.</p> <p>The complex postglacial history of the Baltic Sea caused variations in the scale of the hypoxia. Seafloor sediment studies have shown that the stagnation, anoxia and hydrogen sulphide production are natural phenomena to a certain extent: they took place during the periods when there was a long duration between pulses of oxygen rich saline water from the North Sea, but the areal extent was smaller than today.</p> <p>The Baltic Sea food web models suggest that the fourth trophic level top predators (mammals, large fish, marine birds) controlled the abundance of small fish, and that herbivorous invertebrates controlled the abundance of primary producers.</p> <p><strong>The eutrophic Baltic Sea (circa 1950s &ndash; present)</strong></p> <p>The eutrophic Baltic Sea is characterized by increased sedimentation, increased turbidity, reduced transparency in water and increased algal mats. Anoxic areas have spread and a food web regime shift from a cod-dominated to sprat-dominated regime has occurred. It is uncertain how much eutrophication affects the food web other than primary production and local changes caused by the dead zones.</p> <p>Increased nutrient levels have led to altered nitrogen and phosphorus ratios, increased sedimentation rates and increased input of organic matter to the benthic system. This has in turn led to increased pelagic and benthic primary production, increased turbidity and reduced transparency in the water. Algal blooms can become very large and dense. Reduced oxygen reserves caused by the decomposition of organic matter together with increased occurrences of benthic sulphur bacteria cause dead zones.&nbsp;</p>","<p>Increased anthropogenic nutrient load has been a major driving force behind the oxygen deficiency as it has increased algal production and hence sedimentation of organic matter. Extensive draining of wetlands and lakes has increased the proportion of nutrients that are transported to the Baltic Sea, and the speed with which water (and nutrients) run off the landscape into the Baltic.</p> <p>The limited water exchange with the North Sea and the long residence time of water are the main reasons for the sensitivity of the Baltic Sea to eutrophication. Inflowing dense saline water replaces the old stagnant water in the deeps below the halocline. The displaced stagnant nutrient rich water is brought into the productive surface layer via upwelling (natural internal loading). Phosphorus loading accelerates eutrophication. Vertical stratification of water masses increases the vulnerability of the Baltic Sea to the eutrophication as it hinders or prevents ventilation and oxygenation of the bottom waters and sediments. Only a few Major Baltic Inflows (MBI), large volume inflows of high-salinity water, have been recognized since the mid-1970s. The lack of major inflows is believed to have resulted in a long-term stagnation. North Sea saltwater inflows are irregular and unpredictable. They are governed by large-scale and local meteorological variations and by sea level and salinity distributions.&nbsp;</p>","<p>Increased nutrient loading have changed the Baltic Sea from an oligotrophic low nutrient clear-water sea into a eutrophic higher nutrient, murky sea. The shallow depth, low salinity, and slow rate of water turnover due to limited water exchange with the North Sea make the Baltic Sea particularly susceptible to increases in nutrient concentrations leading to eutrophication, because nutrients discharged to the sea will remain in the basin for a long time. The Baltic Sea has large variances and gradients in topography, geology, hydrography and climate. Hence, the consequences of the eutrophication are different in different parts of the sea.</p> <p>Excessive nutrients promote the growth of photosynthetic plants and algae. Abundant phytoplankton species generate excess photosynthetic production, which the Baltic Sea ecosystem is unable to process. Algal mats sink down to the seafloor and decompose, depleting the oxygen in the near bottom water layer. When the organic biomass decomposing conditions become anoxic, the decomposing bacteria acting on these conditions start to produce hydrogen sulphide, which is extremely toxic. Gradually the living conditions become intolerable for fish and the benthic fauna. Fish move away and benthic fauna dies in masses, resulting in large areas of dead zones in the sea floor. The increase in phytoplankton leads to greater turbidity and thus decreased light penetration, which limits the habitat available for macrophytes.</p> <p>Salinity in the Baltic Sea is low with extreme vertical and horizontal gradients and a permanent halocline at about 50-70m in the Baltic proper. The permanent halocline decreases vertical mixing of the water column, causing the deep areas of the Baltic Proper below the halocline to often run out of oxygen. Inflows of saline water replenish the deep-water layers of the Baltic Sea with saline and well-oxygenated North Sea water. The occurrence of major inflows is driven by major storms in the North Sea pushing water into the Baltic Sea and is therefore irregular and unpredictable. Salinity levels determine species distribution in the several large, ecologically distinct sub-basins of The Baltic Sea.&nbsp;Eutrophication has affected the structure of the food web as top-down control has decreased. Deepwater anoxia in the spawning areas has reduced the cod stock.&nbsp;</p>","<p>Decrease in provisioning fisheries services can be seen in the declines of cod stock and in the cases of contaminated sea food. Cod has high commercial value for humans. Decline of cod has also in part caused a food web change from a cod-dominated to sprat-dominated regime (see case study: Pelagic food web, the Central Baltic Sea). Bladderwrack, which supports diverse faunal communities and is an important nursery environment for fish and many invertebrates, has suffered from the lack of light and declined.&nbsp;Regulative ecosystem services have been lost in water purification as the primary production has become too abundant for the Baltic Sea ecosystem to be able to process. Increase in phytoplankton leads to greater turbidity and thus decreased light penetration, which limits the habitat available for macrophytes. Anoxic areas and hydrogen sulphide production have increased due to decomposing biomass, resulting in large areas of dead zones in the sea floor.</p> <p>Cultural services for water use and creation have been lost. Algal blooms have led to closed beaches, frequent public concerns, large cleanup costs, human health problems, lowered values of coastal properties, and loss of revenue from tourism and recreation.&nbsp;</p>","<p>In 1974 some Baltic Sea countries began to acknowledge that eutrophication was an anthropogenic problem. Since the 1970s, the Helsinki Commission (HELCOM) has provided several recommendations for nutrient reductions. In the 1980s further attention was drawn to the load of nutrients entering the Baltic Sea and HELCOM started to work towards a 50% reduction target. In 1988 the ministers of the environment in the Baltic Sea countries signed a declaration stating that contracting parties were to reduce their emissions.</p> <p>During the last few decades some of the Baltic Sea countries have managed to slow the increase of their nitrogen inputs and even reduce the inputs of phosphorus. During 1990-2000, the direct point-source inputs of phosphorus and nitrogen decreased by 68% and 60%. From 1990-2006 the total inputs to the Baltic Sea were reduced by 45% for phosphorus and 30% for nitrogen. Atmospheric nitrogen decreased since the mid-1990s and increased during 2003-2007.&nbsp;In 2005, the HELCOM launched the Baltic Sea Action Plan Plan. It is a cross-sectional, international program aiming to restore good ecological status of the Baltic marine environment by 2021. All major stakeholders are included and the measures can be taken at regional, national, European and global level.&nbsp;</p>","(#1) Folke C, Hammer M, Jansson Ann-Mari. 1991.

The regime shift described for the Central Baltic Sea involves a drastic change from a cod- to a sprat-dominated ecosystem in a marine food web. Through the biomass decrease of a high trophic level, a commercially high valued and favored table fish was replaced by a low trophic level and low commercial value fish. The prerequisite for the change in the system was most probably loss of resilience, which was caused by poor cod recruitment conditions and too high fishing pressure. Anthropogenic eutrophication and infrequent inflows of saline water from the North Sea contributed to the changed deep water conditions in the Central Baltic, resulting in anoxia and low salinity lowering the cod reproduction rates. Since cod (Gadus morhua) is the main predator of sprat (Sprattus sprattus), the cod decrease caused a trophic cascade as the sprat stock dramatically increased.&nbsp;</p>","Unknown","Marine & coastal","Fisheries","Sub-continental/regional (e.g. southern Africa, Amazon basin)","Europe","Northern Europe","Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Sweden, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia","Harvest and resource consumption, External inputs (eg fertilizers), Species introduction or removal","","Marine & coastal","Nutrient cycling, Water cycling","Biodiversity","Fisheries","Water purification","Recreation, Aesthetic values","Food and nutrition, Health (eg toxins, disease), Livelihoods and economic activity, Cultural, aesthetic and recreational values","","Sub-continental/regional","Years, Decades","Unknown","Models, Contemporary observations, Experiments","Contested – Reasonable evidence both for and against the existence of RS","Contested – Multiple proposed mechanisms, reasonable evidence both for and against different mechanisms","<p><strong>The cod-dominated regime</strong></p> <p>The cod-dominated regime was characterized by abundant cod stocks, not only in the southern part of the Baltic Sea, but also further north and closer to shore. Cod predation regulated the number of sprat and herring. Pseudocalanus spp. dominated the zooplankton community. This regime was observed primarily during the early- to mid-1980s.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Sprat-dominated regime</strong></p> <p>The sprat-dominated regime came into effect in 1989. A lower cod stock, an increased number of sprat and favorable conditions for sprat recruitment characterize the regime. In zooplankton community, Acartia spp. and Temora longicornis are more abundant than Psedocalanus spp. It is suggested that sprat's high predation on zooplankton lead to algal growth and declining oxygen content in deep waters. The high fishing pressure on cod is preventing the recovery of the stock and allowing the sprat to control the zooplankton.&nbsp;</p>","<p>The key drivers for the Central Baltic cod-dominated regime to shift to a sprat-dominated regime are suggested to be poor cod recruitment conditions and too high fishing pressure caused by eutrophication, altered deep water conditions, infrequent inflows of North Sea saline waters and international fishing policies.</p> <p>Climate functions as an indirect driver through changes in the physical environment and altered food supply for early stages. Decreased salinity, increased temperature and high sprat-predation pressure might have caused the regime subshift from Pseudocalanus spp. to Acartia spp. and Temora longicornis. Low salinity and oxygen conditions decrease the amount of the main prey of cod larvae. Higher temperatures support sprat recruitment by improving egg survival and food supply as Acartia spp. and Temora longicornis increase.&nbsp;</p>","<p>Cod is the main predator of sprat. It has been suggested that the large cod stock was able to control the sprat stock in the cod-dominated regime. Anthropogenic eutrophication and infrequent inflows of saline water from the North Sea contributed to increased anoxia and lowered salinity in the Central Baltic.&nbsp;Due to low salinity and oxygen content in the spawning areas, cod reproduction rates have remained low since the early 1980s. Deep water anoxia is a chronic stress for the survival of the cod eggs. Baltic cod needs salinity for the eggs to float in the water. If the required salinity is in anoxic conditions, eggs die.</p> <p>Anoxia is one of the effects of the Baltic Sea eutrophication, but it can be temporarily reduced by inflows of North Sea saline waters, which replenish the deep-water layers of the Baltic Sea with saline and well-oxygenated water. Major Baltic Inflows decreased frequently in the early 1980s and there was a stagnation period until the early 1990s.&nbsp;Although the cod stock decreased due to cod recruitment decline caused by degraded environmental conditions, the fishing effort remained high. Unfavorable cod recruitment conditions and high fishing pressure caused a remarkable drop in cod biomass. As the Central Baltic Sea is characterized by simple food web with low species diversity, cod decrease allowed its' prey sprat to increase. Cod fishing further reduced the stock, making cod even more sensitive to adverse environmental conditions. International fishing quotas have been set to limit the cod fishing but they have not always been followed. The quotas have consistently been greater than the scientific recommendations.</p> <p>Studies suggest that the large increase of the sprat stock has changed the system from mainly bottom-up to top-down trophic control. A trophic cascade occurred as the sprat stock dramatically increased. High sprat abundance changed the quantity and quality of zooplankton, which feeds on phytoplankton. A sub-shift in zooplankton species can be observed to have happened until the end of the 1980s: a shift in dominance occurred from Pseudocalanus spp., the main food supply for cod larvae, to the main food supply of sprat larvae and adults, Acartia spp. and Temora longicornis. Salinity, temperature, predation of sprat, herring and mysids and climate in general regulate the zooplankton species as they all have their specific abiotic preferences. Through trophic cascades large sprat stock also lead to higher phytoplankton biomass and algal blooms during summer. Algae growth promotes further anoxia.&nbsp;A sprat-dominated food web has been suggested to stabilize the cod stock by sprat predating on cod eggs and larvae, and through sprat competing with young cod for zooplankton resources.&nbsp;Changed abundance of sprat may have even been reflected to the top levels of the Baltic food web: the condition of Common Murre (Uria aalge) chicks seem to increase and decrease in relation to sprat stock. This way human exploitation combined to natural changes caused variations in several trophic levels, which altered the ecosystem functioning as the interaction between species changed.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>The main ecosystem services associated with the cod-dominated regime were commercially viable, high value cod stocks, recreational value of large cod stocks and a sustainable small-scale fishing sector favoring regional development. The regime was possibly related to high water quality stimulating tourism development. Cod provide the Baltic Sea region with provisioning services: Cod is commercially the most important species in the Baltic Sea for a large number of fishermen. In the sprat-dominated region, the economic value of the catch for human consumption decreases due to the relative composition of the fish species.&nbsp;Being a predator at the top of the food chain, cod provides the Baltic Sea with regulating ecosystem services: cod reduces sprat, which prey on zooplankton and early life stages of cod. The high summer levels of phytoplankton could partly be a result of the sprat predation-induced decrease in total zooplankton biomass. The decay of increased algae leads to oxygen deficit and thereby causes damage to the biodiversity. The regulating role of cod may also be reflected to the top levels of the Baltic food web, the sea birds.&nbsp;The sprat-dominated regime is dominated by low value fish used for reduction fisheries and international fish meal and fish oil markets. These large-scale fisheries are mainly based outside the Baltic Sea region, which makes the regime less advantageous for the local development. The sprat-dominated regime may be associated with cascading effects on water quality as the low biomass of summer zooplankton may increase the probability for cyanobacterial blooms.</p> <p>Low cod biomass makes industrial fishing and businesses associated with recreational fishing less profitable.&nbsp;Increased occurrence of algal blooms makes the Baltic Sea less attractive for tourists and recreation. From the socioeconomic perspective, tourist industry is more important than fishing industry in for example Sweden. The Baltic Sea environment and its cultural fishing surroundings are important tourist attractions. The toxic blooms and low water quality are nuisance for coastal property owners, local enterprises, bathers and others seeking for creation on the coasts.&nbsp;</p>","<p>The goal for managing the regime shift is to maintain the resilience of the Baltic Sea ecosystem by targeting eutrophication and recovery of the cod stock. The management actions to reduce nutrient pollution began in the 1970s, when Helsinki Commission (HELCOM) adopted several recommendations for all sectors (industry, agriculture, wastewater treatment). Since the 1980s, HELCOM has worked with the 50% reduction targets for nutrients and discharges. Several countries have recently agreed to substantially reduce fertilizer use in the region (Baltic Sea Action Plan).&nbsp;In 1990s, it became obvious that the important Baltic Sea fish stocks were in a poor state and the fisheries were not under satisfactory control. The International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission (IBSFC) reacted with several resolutions to reduce fishing mortality and improve selectivity for cod. The main initiatives were to improve control and enforcement to assure adherence to TACs, set TACs based on target fishing mortalities, introduce technical measures to improve selectivity, and seasonal closures of areas to protect the spawning stock. However, the overexploitation of cod resources continued: the scientific advice was disregarded when setting quotas and the quotas restricting exploitation were not enforced.</p> <p>In 1999, a Long-Term Management Strategy for Cod Stocks in the Baltic Sea was made including e.g. efforts to maintain a minimum spawning-stock biomass. The Recovery Plan for Baltic Sea Cod was developed in 2001 requiring a.o. seasonal closures and ban on fishing on the cod spawning grounds. Still, the problems remained and in 2004 it was acknowledged that the state of the cod stock had not improved, requiring determined action based on scientific advice. The EU agreed a plan for the Baltic Sea cod in 2007.&nbsp;In 2009 and 2010, The European Council Regulation for the Baltic TAC involved reductions in the number of fishing days per year. The cod fisheries are regulated by a seasonal closure to protect spawning fish. A year-round area closure for all fisheries in specific parts of the Bornholm Deep, the Gotland Basin and the Gdansk Deep was introduced in 2005.</p> <p>High-grading has been prohibited since 2010 in all Baltic fisheries. In 2003, the minimum landing size was raised from 35 cm to 38 cm to protect the juvenile cods, which have not had a chance to reproduce yet. Additionally, fishing nets with exit windows have been introduced. To combat illegal fishing EU Commission has made inspections on randomly selected vessels and concluded that illegal fishing is substantial and practiced by many Baltic Sea countries.&nbsp;</p>","(#1) Alheit J, Möllman C, Dutz J, Kornilovs G, Loewe P, Mohrholz V, Wasmund N. 2005.

The productive domains resulted from a distinctive kind of management both at field and landscape levels that involved extended fallow periods practices aimed at naturally regenerating soils fertility coupled with strong laws local together with rules and norms for natural resources management . Consequently, the system developed along a trajectory where plentiful and easily accessible of on- as well as off-farm provisioning ecosystem services was generated to support a relatively low population living in the system over time. Early 1980s, the agro-ecosystem underwent dramatic changes that happened concomitantly and pushed the system into the degraded regime. These changes encompass increasing dry-spell frequencies, rapid institutional changes, and population growth that triggered a spiral of mutually enforcing feedbacks, involving increased cropping intensity, cultivation of more marginal lands, yields declines, soil fertility decline and loss of provisioning ecosystem services generated by the catchment. That situation has inexorably set the system on a development path where food and other ecosystem services are not generated fast enough to support local population over time. As a result, local populations appear to be caught into a persistent poverty conditions referred to as poverty traps. There is, however, a window of opportunity which is conducive to sustainably dealing with these highly complex challenges. These include a mix of small water system technologies that bear high prospects for stabilising even increasing agro-ecological productivity, and efficient and enforceable institutional mechanisms that guarantee a successful resource base management.</p>","Bio-productivity shift in dry-land agro-ecosystems","Drylands & deserts (below ~500mm rainfall/year)","Small-scale subsistence crop cultivation","Local/landscape (e.g. lake, catchment, community)","Africa","Eastern Africa","Tanzania","Soil erosion & land degradation, Environmental shocks (eg floods)","Small-scale subsistence crop cultivation","Drylands & deserts, Agro-ecosystems","Soil formation, Nutrient cycling","Biodiversity","Food crops, Livestock, Wild animal and plant products, Timber, Woodfuel","Climate regulation, Water purification, Regulation of soil erosion","Knowledge and educational values","Food and nutrition, Livelihoods and economic activity, Social conflict","","Local/landscape","Decades","Readily reversible","Contemporary observations","Well established – Wide agreement in the literature that the RS exists","Well established – Wide agreement on the underlying mechanism","<p><strong>Productive regime: </strong>The landscape was dominated by dense forest-like bush vegetation covering the hill sides that delineated the catchment and bushland covering most of its valley. Only a small portion of the land was used for farming. The soils in the catchment were more fertile. However, had fertility on a particular field declined, it was left in fallow and another plot was used instead. The extended fallow periods practices used ensured the regeneration of natural fertility of soil that guaranteed stable yields levels. In addition, wildlife was abundant as well as provisioning ecosystem services other than food used in daily life, such as firewood, timber, grasses, wild vegetables, fruits and medicinal plants. Honey and fibres were also readily available in the catchment. According to Elin and Gordon (2007), this regime is described as one during which natural resources were plentiful and easily accessible for the relatively low population in the area. More importantly is the fact that the use of these resources was regulated both by strong externally imposed laws that regulated the use of land, water and forests (Anderson, 1984), and by strong local institutions which protected common property resources such as sacred forests, irrigation systems, and swamps (Sheridan,2004).</p> <p><strong>Degraded regime</strong>: The degraded regime which started since 1961 to present is characterised by a general depreciation of provisioning ecosystem services together with decreasing crop yield levels. The latter in part accounted for an institutional change both at local and national levels as to the access and use of natural resources. This situation has led to over-utilisation of resources, and in practice both transhumant pastoralism and the use of extended fallow periods became increasingly abandoned (Kikula, 1998). Vegetation cover throughout the catchment decreased because of the agricultural expansion compounded by contemporaneous decline in rainfall. Reduced rainfall has promoted a shift from single to double annual cropping cycles which marked an intensification of the farming system (Enfors and Gordon, 2007). This has led to a degraded regime with varied impacts on ecosystem services and human wellbeing. &nbsp;</p>","<p>Due to increasing dry-spell frequencies in the catchment (Usman and Reason, 2004), smallholder agro-ecosystems experienced frequent crop failures on farm level. This resulted from less moisture in crop root zone which in turn impacted negatively on the plant productivity response (Enfors and Gordon, 2007). That led to a situation where farmers not only suffered from frequent depletion of accumulated capital but also adopted strategies of risk minimization resulting in less investment in farming (Enfors and Gordon, 2008). Furthermore, population growth shifted the number of annual cropping cycles from double to single and shortened fallow periods. These changes have given raise to lowering input/outtake ratio on farm level such that they increase biomass removal from the field when harvesting, contributing to the impoverishment of the soil over time (Koning and Smaling, 2005), hence accounting for the decline in soil fertility.</p> <p>Rapid institutional change led to three specific consequences as to natural resources management in the catchment. For one, these changes resulted in less respect for local natural resource management laws and protected areas on the landscape level (Enfors and Gordon, 2007). That led to an increased outtake of off-farm provisioning ecosystem services, for examples logging and grazing which incidentally contributed to gully erosion phenomena across the catchment. In addition, it brought about the expansion of farmland which encroached into other types of ecosystems that were previously protected by both local rules and norms and externally imposed laws (Anderson, 1984; Sheridan, 2004). Agricultural user rights, which is a form of land entitlement was granted to farmers through cultivation. This kind of land ownership newly established contributed even more to the expansion of farmlands. The last institutional change altered resource use patterns that gave rise to shorter fallows which impacted negatively on soil fertility. These changes occurred contemporaneously within a short period of time, reducing the adaptive capacity of farmers in the system to cope with the new challenges (Enfors and Gordon, 2007).</p>","<p>The productive regime in Makanya agro-ecological system was maintained by a reinforcing feedback loop. Stabilised yield levels resulted from a relatively stable soil fertility, which stems from their high organic matter content and their good surface structure. This was supported by extended fallow period practices which improved the input/ outtake ratio through humus generation from organic matter degradation into the soil over relatively long periods of time restoring thus the natural fertility at farm level. Because of stable crop yield levels on farm as well as the small size of the population, the pressure on the surrounding landscape was insignificant.&nbsp; As a result, plentiful ecosystem services were readily available for the populations living in the catchment. On the other hand, the abundant arable lands allowed extended fallow periods with the effects mentioned earlier and the cycle repeats itself reinforcing the capacity of the agro-ecological system to sustain the people living in it. However, decline in yield levels due to low soil fertility together with increasing population growth induced more land conversions to croplands, hence cultivation of more marginal lands. It follows that other types of ecosystems are destroyed on the way leading to a loss of provisioning ecosystem services in the catchment which results in an increased cropping intensity. One of the most characteristics of cropping intensity is the reduction of the input/outtake ratio resulting from a high exportation of soil nutrients as well as organic matter content without any investments into the farming to make up for the loss incurred. Consequently, soil fertility declines due to impaired surface soil structure as well as deficiency in nutrients and organic matter which results in yield levels declines. This increased cultivation of more marginal lands to maintain food production to sustain the population needs. The iterative process of this cycle erodes the productive potential of the system over time.</p>","<p>The regime shift led to changes in the ecological system of the catchment, evidenced by disappearance of larger wild animals and reduced quantity of wild plants. High population growth limited availability of farming land in the upper and middle parts of the catchment, even though large areas of bushland have been cleared and converted to cropland over the past decades (Enfors and Gordon, 2007). The land conversions have further created a lack of grazing areas, and increased conflicts between livestock keepers and farmers. Overgrazing in the small patches of grazing areas left coupled with illegal logging upstream have both accelerated soil erosion in the mid- and downstream areas. This process has not only impacted land fertility but has also led to a declined in provisioning ecosystem services used in day-to-day life, specifically firewood, grasses, local medicines and honey which are becoming increasingly difficult to find in the catchment (Enfors and Gordon, 2007).</p>","<p>Small-scale water system innovations (SWSIs) such as in situ rainwater harvesting and conservation tillage can play a role for navigating towards development trajectories with higher agro-ecological productivity (Enfors and Gordon, 2007).That is supported by a growing body of research demonstrating that SWSIs can contribute to closing the yield gap between smallholder farmers&rsquo; actual and potential yields (Liu et al. 2005; Rocstr&ouml;m et al. 2009; Rocstr&ouml;m et al. 2002; Mazvimavi and Twomlow in press).</p> <p>From a management perspective, the improvement in soil organic matter from conservation tillage suggests that SWSIs have the potential to move the threshold for crop failure towards a lower level of rainfall and/or a poorer distribution, through increases in soil water holding capacity that incidentally would lead to a drop in crop failures in the 250-350 mm rainfall range (Rocstr&ouml;m et al. 2002). As the frequency of crop failures lowers, farmers are able to accumulate enough capital allowing them to invest in their production systems that would increase input/output ratios by improving levels of nutrients and organic matter content of soils. Furthermore, increased productivity and stabilised yields at farm level can potentially reduce the farmers&rsquo; need for complementing resources, lowering pressure on the surrounding resource base.</p> <p>Finally, improved farming systems that deliver more food produced per unit area reduces the need for expansion of farmland. However, unpublished data from Makanya suggest that the assumed relation between intensification and expansion is only a valid assumption above some threshold in productivity per capita (Enfors and Gordon, 2007). In addition to these effects, SWSIs may also influence current feedbacks directly. At field level, they change the water balance (eg. Makurira et al.2007b) in two ways. First, the change increases the availability of soil moisture and opens up for higher yields (Makurira et al. 2009). When the field becomes denser, there is a shift from evaporation to transpiration (Rockstr&ouml;m 2003b), further improving productivity. Secondly, the changing water balance entails a shift in surface to sub-surface flows of water which in agro-ecosystems such as Makanya, where cultivation of steep slopes upstream has led to severe gully erosion, this may imply restoration of a lost ecosystem service (UNEP/SEI 2009, Vohland and Barry 2009) to some extent.</p>","(#1) Coulson A. 1982.

During the 1970s, the Indonesian government decided to carry-out a Green Revolution to face the challenge of an increasing internal population demanding more food. Several changes at different levels where introduced: high-yielding varieties of rice were distributed among the farmers, together with a tech-package of pesticides and fertilizers; and the water temples were restricted from regulating water distribution. After a couple of decades of successful increase in production, problems regarding water distribution and pest outbreaks, lead to the recognition of the functional role of Subaks and Water Temples in managing these two factors, so the Indonesian government withdrew the restriction. However, an important percentage of farmers decided to continue using the high-yielding rice varieties, together with pesticides and fertilizers. Given that this agricultural tech-package costs money, the &lsquo;rice production &ndash; cash income&rsquo; feedback gained strength over &lsquo;rice production &ndash; subsistence&rsquo;, which dominated before the Green Revolution, and was sustained by a variety of agricultural practices that articulated in a more complex form. Cultural and economic dimensions of globalization set the context for this shift, with an increasing importance of money in mediating local social relations, and a slow change in world-views, beliefs and values. Possible negative effects of this farm-level shift in agricultural practices are a fast degradation of soil quality and an increased input of phosphorus to the sea by runoff.</p>","Unknown","Tropical Forests","Small-scale subsistence crop cultivation, Tourism","Local/landscape (e.g. lake, catchment, community)","Indian Ocean","Southern Bali","Indonesia","Adoption of new technology","Small-scale subsistence crop cultivation, Tourism","Tropical forests, Agro-ecosystems","Nutrient cycling","Biodiversity","Freshwater, Food crops","","Knowledge and educational values","Livelihoods and economic activity","","Local/landscape","Decades","","Contemporary observations","Speculative – Regime shift has been proposed, but little evidence as yet","Speculative – Mechanisms have been proposed, but little evidence as yet","<p><strong>Subsistence-oriented, rice-based livelihood (with organic, self-sufficient farming)</strong></p> <p>Traditionally, in these Balinese farms rice production based on local rice varieties represents the main economic activity, and it is performed in a 'self-sufficient way' by relying on the articulation of several practices, such as keeping ducks for local pest control and cows for manure (Lansing et al. 2001; Marion et a.l 2005). This articulation of farming activities is time/labour demanding for members of the household, allowing less time for off-farm economic activities.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Market-oriented, diversified livelihood (with agrochemical-dependent farming)</strong></p> <p>The Green Revolution in Indonesia in the 1970s, presented to Balinese farmers a 'technological packet' including high-yielding rice varieties, chemical fertilizers (nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus) and pesticides (Lansing et al. 2001; Marion et al. 2005). Ever since, some households have replaced some of the labour/time intensive activities traditionally used, with these modern capital intensive inputs. Hence, in this regime household members have to devote less time to within-farm activities, but on the other hand, since access to these inputs requires money, it becomes imperative that an increasing part of their labour/time is devoted to monetized labour (i.e. selling more rice in the market, and/or other economic activities in tourism and commerce, for example).</p>","<p>An agricultural credit system developed to promote the use of the 'technological packet' was a key aspect of the Green Revolution in Indonesia enabling the farm-level regime shift in Balinese rice production. To boost rice production, these programs focused on the modernization of the country-side, and the breakdown of traditional management practices (Lansing 2006). This provided the conditions for intimately linking the farming practices to the monetized economy, and as a consequence modifying local livelihoods by allowing/forcing the diversification of economic activities.</p> <p>Parallel to the increased connection with external markets for agriculture, importance of tourism has continually increased, providing a context for more non-agricultural, off-farm activities (Liater &amp; Me 2003). Further, increased monetary incomes are invested in formal education of younger generations; education which tends to detach them more from agricultural activites (Lorentz &amp; Lorentz, 2010).</p>","<p>In the rice production system of subsistence-orientated rice-based livelihood, the household subsists by ensuring a constant cycle of cultivating and harvesting rice, which depends on both on collective behaviours involving other households, and also within-farm practices. For such practices, members of households in this regime devote most of their time on them, keeping rice production as the economic dominating activity. Under conditions in which such time/labour demanding activities are not 'easily' replaceable, this regime persists.</p> <p>The agriculture credit system linked to the use of technological packet enabled this replacement. This change both enabled the diversification of economic activities by offering more time flexibility, and demanded an increase in the monetized labour activities. The threshold dividing these two regimes is then related with the importance of money to mediate social and economic interactions on Bali. The increased time flexibility also leads to an increasing access to formal educations, which further leaded to a dominance of non-agricultural economic activities by younger generations, strengthening the trajectory away from the&nbsp;subsistence-orientated rice-based livelihood regime.</p>","<p>Both regimes provide rice yields, however the (agro)biodiversity is diminished by the shift described, not only by the adoption of few high-yielding varieties, but also by the effect of pesticides on soil and water habitats. Although the aesthetic value of these landscapes has always been 'provided', the development of infrastructure and training related with tourism increase its perception, and hence its worth in the market-orientated diversified regime.</p>","<p>.</p>","(#1) Booth, A. 2002.

This system flipped from a regime characterized by a diversified use of ecosystems, oriented mainly to subsistence and based on cooperative institutions (regime 1), to one centred on timber extraction, oriented mainly to the market and based of remunerated labour (regime 2). Regime 1 was in place for more than two centuries, not just for that population, but for virtually all the afrodescendant groups in de Colombian and Ecuadorian Pacific coast. However, in the last decades a change in the way these communities relate with the environment, as a result from the interventions from the State and big companies, has been documented. In this particular case, the shift seems to have occurred around the 1970s, after a series of biophysical and economic shocks that affected an already stressed system. One key driver was population growth, while two proposed external drivers of change were 1) the many social and production programmes designed by the national government that portrayed the local ways as inefficient and tried to replace them; and 2) the presence of big timber companies influencing a change in way ‘labour’ was viewed. The main feedback loop locking the system in this new regime is the one that links ‘timber extraction’, monetary income’ and ‘satisfaction of basic needs and desires’, and that now dominates over the one that links ‘agriculture’, ‘goods’ and ‘satisfaction of basic needs and desires’. This is further amplified by the almost complete disappearance of cooperative forms of labour, that where replaced by remunerated ones. The impact on the ecosystem is an increasing rate of timber extraction, and related with this, a change in the edapho-hydric conditions, that could in time lead to a change in the composition of these forests. Human well-being has been affected negatively as the current situation is of high dependence on timber prices and reduced food autonomy.</p>","socio-economic","Marine & coastal, Tropical Forests","Timber production","Local/landscape (e.g. lake, catchment, community)","South America","Chocó biogeographic region","Colombia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(#1) Del Valle JI & Restrepo E.

The productive regime was maintained by land use characterized by scattered rural populations cultivating small fields amidst surrounding bush. Yields were sufficient and there were abundant supplies of forest products made possible by wet climatic conditions. The implementation of a new land law established the national government as the owner of all trees and provided disincentives for farmers to care for their land. This led to the exposure of soils to the Sahara winds resulting in erosion and accelerating desertification. This resulted in hunger and destitute among many people. Key institutional changes with regards to land tenure and tree growth were put in place along with simple soil and water conservation techniques, rock lining, improved versions of traditional planting pits or tasa, and demi-lunes which have reversed desertification.

Population densities are smaller with sufficient yields and ample supplies of timber and other forest products from natural woodlands. Fallow practices are common allowing fields to rest, and trees and shrubs are regenerated to provide extra wood before being cleared for planting (Winterbottom 2008). The most important feature of this regime is the fallow time which&nbsp;allows the environment to keep its natural productive capacity intact and provide a host of services such as soil and water conservation, increased soil fertility and goods among which food crops and fuel-wood in abundance.&nbsp;More importantly is that that productive period coincided with the wet decades that spanned from 1900 through with higher rainfalls during the 1920s, 1930s and 1950 (Hulme 2001).</p> <p><strong>Desert Regime&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The desert regime traces back to early 1960s, punctuated by the increasingly episode that commenced in the Sahel in the late 1960s, and which culminated in severe droughts in 1973, 1984 and 1990 (Warren 1995), and continues today. It is generally depicted as a regime characterised by an ongoing depreciation in ecosystem services and goods and moving towards a desert ecosystem. The landscapes are dominated by vast expanses of savannah devoid of vegetation under desertification threats until the early 1980s. This has resulted from a series of practices as a consequences of the enactment of institutional arrangements and enforced by both the French colonial government as well as the successive post-colonial governments.

By clearing native trees and shrubs, farmers exposed their lands to the fierce Sahara winds, resulting in plummeting soil fertility and harvests as a result of increased erosion. The loss of tree cover also triggered a rural fuel-wood crisis. Poor households were forced to burn animal dung or crop residues instead of using them for compost, reinforcing the downward spiral in soil quality and crop yields declines (Rinaudo 2007; Winterbottom 2008). Incidentally that resulted in an increase in intensity of cultivation of land reducing thus the fallow time to keep up with the production levels needed to feed an increasing human population which made it that woodlands were to be converted into farmland. That, in turn, contributed to land clearing and tree-felling and the cycle repeated itself in a reinforcing feedback loop.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The shrinking of Niger&rsquo;s natural tree cover was exacerbated by a rapid population growth. That was a result of the perversely positive outcomes of the effective French health care system, notably higher life expectancy and lower infant mortality which incidentally increased a strain on natural resources (Brough &amp; Kimenyi 2002). Therefore by 1975 much of the remaining natural woodland had been converted to farm fields to feed rapidly growing rural communities increasing consequently intensity of land cultivation which, in turn, reduces yield per hectare making food production one of recurrent problem for food security. As a result, the practice of fallow was abandoned altogether. By 2015, the Niger&rsquo;s population will rise to 18.8 million and the area of cultivable land per capita will fall further- from 1.45 to 1.12 ha per person (Wentling 2008).&nbsp;But by clearing native trees and shrubs, farmers exposed their fields to the fierce winds, resulting in plummeting soil fertility and thereby harvests. In addition to the damaging effects of Sahara winds, the latter destroyed seeds in Niger&rsquo;s June-to-October growing season that resulted more often in repeating sowing, destroying newly planted crops. The third and last driver is a series of an extreme 4-year drought that triggered famine across the Sahel in general through yield failures by impairing moisture in crop root zone, afflicting 50 million of people (Dan Baria 1999). Over the last 45 years, Niger has been plagued by an average of one bad harvest every eight years, following a growing season of low rainfall (Wentling 2008). That has exposed farmers to deadly cyclical droughts, which are predicted to increase as a result of climate change (Reij 2006; IPCC, 2007). These frequents droughts henceforth have increased rainfall variability that jeopardise bio-productivity of the system under study.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","","<p>The shift from a productive land use to a desert regime has direct impact on biodiversity of the area, causes soil erosion and decreases productivity therefore affecting provisioning services such as fuel-wood, and food for the local communities.</p> <p>This has a direct impact on human wellbeing as it has increased poverty, hunger, malnutrition, imbalanced diets and sometimes even&nbsp;death.</p>","<p>Much of hope that has reversed desertification has come from the transformation of vast expanses of savannah devoid of vegetation into relatively densely studded landscapes with trees, shrubs, and crops. That has been achieved through an unprecedented, farmer-led re-greening movement initiated by the Maradi Integrated Development Project (MIDP) featuring a new approach to reforestation (Rinaudo 2005). This&nbsp;approach consists of&nbsp;low-cost techniques for managing the natural regeneration of trees and shrubs, known as farmer-managed natural regeneration, or FMNR. These techniques involved supporting the regeneration of trees and their sustainable management to produce continuous supplies of fuel-wood as well as non-timber products such as edible seeds and leaves. MIDP&rsquo;s effort entailed few rules emphasizing farmer experimentation and choice. In fact, farmers chose how many trees stumps to let re-sprout in their fields, how many re-sprouted stems to grow and harvest, and what to do with the wood (Rinaudo 2005). By planting alternate rows of neem (Azadirachta indica) -an exotic nursery-grown species &ndash;and a native Acasia nilotica saplings across the valley to act as windbreaks, this techniques improved soil retention and fertility (Steinberg 1988).&nbsp;Re-vegetation also improves the traditional poor fertility of Niger&rsquo;s soils, which in turn boosts crop production. Bush trees dotted across fields help hold soil in place, reducing wind and water erosion (Guero &amp;&nbsp;Dan Lamso 2006). Moreover, the growing season on land with trees is longer because farmers only have to sow once, compared with twice or more on fields unprotected from the elements (Rinaudo 2005; Reij 2008). Such benefits are magnified when farmers act collectively. Vegetation in one field affects nearby land by serving as a windbreak and promoting improved water infiltration and soil retention (Winterbottom 2007).&nbsp;Besides the FMNR much of the success of the re-greening movement can also be attributed to the simultaneous soil and conservation work. In fact, simple soil and water conservation techniques were used to rehabilitate barren land. These widely adopted techniques consist of rock lining, improved versions of traditional planting pits or tasa, and demi-lunes that improve water infiltration into soil thereby increasing moisture in the root zone (Abdoulaye and Ibro, 2006). These techniques enabled cultivation of secondary vegetable crops such as onions, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, cow peas, watermelon, and asparagus for home use and sale in local markets (Guero &amp;&nbsp;Dan Lamso 2006).&nbsp;This simple and cost-effective practice of farmer-managed natural regeneration has provided an impressively wide range of benefits for Niger&rsquo;s impoverish rural communities. Over the last 30 years or so, about 200 million trees have been protected and managed by farmers in the FMNR regions and at least 250,000 ha of degraded land has been restored to crop production (Reij 2008; McGahuey &amp; Winterbottom; 2007). On the other hand, there has been a perceptible trend in the increase in rainfall that has recently been noticed across the Sahel region as a whole that might also account for that change that is happening.</p>","(#1) Abdoulaye T. and G Ibro. 2006.
